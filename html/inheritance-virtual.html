<h2>[20.1] What is a &quot;<tt>virtual</tt> member function&quot;?</h2>

<p>
<b class="FAQ"><a href="http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/virtual-functions.html#faq-20.1">FAQ:</a></b>
 The most important thing about C++ if you look from an OO perspective.
</p>

<p>
With <tt>virtual</tt> functions, derived classes can provide new implementations of functions from their base classes.
When someone calls a <tt>virtual</tt> function of an object of the derived class, this new implementation is called,
even if the caller uses a pointer to the base class, and doesn&#39;t even know about the particular derived class.
</p>

<p>
The derived class can completely &quot;override&quot; the implementation or &quot;augment&quot; it (by explicitly calling the base class implementation in addition to the new things it does).
</p>

<p>
<b class="FQA">FQA:</b> If you are new to OO, using C++ as your first example is not a very good idea. If you
still want to start learning about OO here, and you feel you didn&#39;t really understand the
very generic statements above, here&#39;s an example attempting to show why all this is
actually <i>useful</i>. Note: this FQA is unlikely to be the best OO tutorial on the web.
</p>

<p>
Suppose you have a program which plays movies in different formats. No matter what the format
is, you want to have the same interface (a window with a menu), options (resize the window, control the color balance...), etc.
Now, you can define a class <tt>Movie</tt> with <tt>virtual</tt> functions like <tt>nextFrame(&amp;pixels,&amp;width,&amp;height)</tt>.
Each format is implemented in a derived class like <tt>MPEGMovie</tt>, <tt>DivXMovie</tt>... The code implementing the interface, the options,
etc. can then work with <tt>Movie</tt> objects, calling the right <tt>nextFrame</tt> function without having stuff like <tt>if(format==MPEG) { MPEG_nextFrame(...); } else if ...</tt>
all over the place. The format-independent code is easier to read, and much easier to change when you want to add a new format, in fact
as easy as it gets: you don&#39;t have to change anything.
</p>

<p>
If this last sentence made you laugh, you&#39;ve probably seen how representation-specific a supposedly &quot;generic&quot; interface
turned out to be once someone actually tried to create a second or a third implementation. You can laugh silently, or you
can do it out loud, to soon find yourself surrounded by newbies cluttering their code with idiotic conditions (&quot;the wizard said that nothing is really generic anyway&quot;).
So let&#39;s forget the whole &quot;pseudo-generic&quot; issue for the moment and focus on the C++ flavor of polymorphism instead (to those who didn&#39;t know: hordes of languages have something like <tt>virtual</tt>, and normally it&#39;s something better).
</p>

<p>
<tt>virtual</tt> functions have their problems. The keyword itself is obscure, the <tt>=0;</tt> notation is even more so, you can&#39;t
look at a derived class and say which functions are <tt>virtual</tt> (the keyword is optional), and overloading makes it even
harder to see when a function actually overrides a base class implementation (forget a <tt>const</tt> in the prototype and it becomes an unrelated <tt>virtual</tt> function with the same name).
Seasoned OO pros might point out the lack of multimethods and invariants/contracts checking, and have other complaints that I no longer remember, but which
seemed valid when I did. Oh, and there&#39;s the poor RTTI and the non-existing reflection. It goes on and on.
</p>

<p>
However, compared to other C++ features, <tt>virtual</tt> functions are excellent. They make a very useful thing easy. You get
to type less compared to C, where you would have to create a &quot;vtable&quot; struct and then do things like <tt>pThis-&gt;vptr-&gt;f((Base*)pThis, args)</tt>
instead of the C++ <tt>p-&gt;f(args)</tt>. And this brevity does <i>not</i> come at the price C++ makes you to pay so promptly - there&#39;s
no compile time overhead.
</p>

<p>
Therefore, if you are a practitioner using C++, ignoring the <a href="ctors.html#fqa-10.9">"performance-oriented"</a> brain-washing (&quot;arrays of pointers to objects with virtual methods are soooo slow, arrays of structs with inline functions are soooo fast&quot;)
and using the single C++ feature that has a potential of doing less harm than good is very frequently the right thing to do.
Of course not using C++ for code characterized by complicated structure and dynamic behavior is an even better idea.
</p>

<h2>[20.2] How can C++ achieve dynamic binding yet also static typing?</h2>

<p>
<b class="FAQ"><a href="http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/virtual-functions.html#faq-20.2">FAQ:</a></b>
 <i>Static typing</i> means that when a function (<tt>virtual</tt> or other) is called, the compiler checks that the function
call is valid according to the statically defined interfaces.
</p>

<p>
<i>Dynamic binding</i> means that the code generated from the statically checked function calls may actually call many different
implementations, and figures out the one to call at run time.
</p>

<p>
Basically C++ allows many things to be done upon a <tt>virtual</tt> function call, as long as these things follow a specified
protocol - the base class definition.
</p>

<p>
<b class="FQA">FQA:</b> It&#39;s important to keep in mind that the compiler can only check whether an implementation follows a protocol to a certain
extent. It is pretty easy to create a derived class which looks legitimate (it has an <tt>insert</tt> and a <tt>find</tt> method as specified in the base class),
but in fact it is not (because <tt>insert</tt> doesn&#39;t really insert anything to anywhere, and <tt>find</tt> doesn&#39;t find anything).
This will break the code using the derived class via pointers to base class objects
(this code will <tt>insert</tt> something and then won&#39;t <tt>find</tt> it and will crash). That&#39;s why the FAQ has a whole section on <a href="inheritance-proper.html#fqa-21.12">proper inheritance</a>.
</p>

<p>
The (natural) fact that you can&#39;t find all errors with static typing wouldn&#39;t be that bad if C++ didn&#39;t crash as hard as it does
(for instance, by doing run time boundary checking), and/or would support dynamic contract checking, and/or
had a clear type system that would make specifying interfaces less of a pain (currently you have a zillion troubles ranging from no built-in string type to the endless kinds of type relationships and conversion rules).
</p>

<p>
Dynamic binding is a critical feature to build extensible software, and all general-purpose programming languages have some form of it
(in particular, C has function pointers). Unlike dynamic binding, static typing is not strictly necessary, but it has
many benefits (the code may be easier for people to read and for compilers to validate and optimize due to the information specified in the types)
as well as many drawbacks (some things may be hard to model in a static type system, frequently there&#39;s more code to read and write, etc.).
At the language level, C++ doesn&#39;t support dynamic <i>typing</i> (as opposed to &quot;binding&quot;) at all, and its static type system is <a href="const.html#fqa-18.2">one of the worst</a>.
</p>

<p>
Some C++ programmers think (or feel) that their compiler does an incredible service of finding virtually all of their bugs.
Their hidden motives include the need to rationalize the <a href="inline.html#fqa-9.3">amazingly long build cycles</a>, and to avoid writing test programs
(more verbose, ugly, boring C++ code - who wants to do that?!). You&#39;ll do yourself a favor by not catching their thinking habits.
</p>


<a name="fqa-20.3"></a>
<h2>[20.3] What&#39;s the difference between how <tt>virtual</tt> and non-<tt>virtual</tt> member functions are called?</h2>

<p>
<b class="FAQ"><a href="http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/virtual-functions.html#faq-20.3">FAQ:</a></b>
 non-<tt>virtual</tt> functions are resolved at compile time. <tt>virtual</tt> functions are resolved at run time.
</p>

<p>
The compiler must generate some code to do the run-time resolution. This code must be able to look at an object
and find the version of the function defined by the class of the object. This is usually done by creating a table
of virtual functions for each class having them (the &quot;vtable&quot;). All objects of the class have an implicitly generated
member pointer (the &quot;vptr&quot;), initialized to point to the class vtable by all constructors.
</p>

<p>
To implement a virtual function call, the compiler generates code similar to that it would produce from the C expression
<tt>(*p-&gt;vptr-&gt;func_ptr)</tt>. That is, it dereferences the object pointer to fetch the vptr, then fetches the function pointer
from a fixed offset, then calls the function through the pointer.
</p>

<p>
The exact cost depends on complicated stuff like page faults, multiple inheritance, etc.
</p>

<p>
<b class="FQA">FQA:</b> In practice, the cost is almost never a big deal unless you call <tt>virtual</tt> functions in your &quot;innermost loops&quot;
(the code processing the most data). I&#39;m not saying the cost should be ignored - a good-looking generic design centered around virtual calls
in innermost loops is invalid for most practical purposes. I&#39;m just saying that you don&#39;t have to think about things like
page faults to figure out if you can afford <tt>virtual</tt> in this piece of code. The C++ implementation of polymorphism is pretty efficient.
</p>

<p>
One kind of price you pay for this efficiency is the <a href="class.html#fqa-7.4">instability</a> of your interfaces at the binary level. You <i>can</i>
add new derived classes to your system without recompiling old derived classes. But you <i>can&#39;t</i> add a virtual function
to a base class without such recompilation. This rules out straight-forward usage of virtual functions in many situations
(if you think recompilation has &quot;zero cost&quot;, try to get the vendors of your desktop software to recompile it so it runs
 on a different processor architecture).
</p>

<p>
Many OO languages avoid these problems. One way to do it is just-in-time compilation - instead of generating code fetching
the function pointer from a fixed vtable offset, wait until you see all the updated base class definitions at program load time
and then generate the offsets. Another option is to use less efficient, but more flexible look-up mechanisms, such as
hash tables - this is typically coupled with the lack of static typing, which has many benefits and drawbacks. Both
techniques avoid a huge amount of real-life problems with binary interface stability.
</p>

<p>
If you can&#39;t switch to a different OO language with better OO support (think about it - the interface stability is just
one aspect, you&#39;ll probably also get <a href="heap.html#fqa-16.1">garbage collection</a>, <a href="templates.html#fqa-35.12">faster build cycles</a>, and a ton of other useful things), you
can work around these problems in many ugly ways. For example, you can have a single <tt>virtual</tt> function getting
a string or a <tt>void*</tt> telling it what to do (a famous example of achieving binary-level stability this way is the <tt>ioctl</tt> system call of Unix-like systems).
Another approach is to add new classes for the new functions, and have the derived classes implement many different
abstract base classes (the COM <tt>QueryInterface</tt> function works this way). These things are not pretty, but they are
better than nothing, which is what <tt>virtual</tt> functions deliver when you need stable interfaces.
</p>

<p>
Don&#39;t be ashamed of yourself if you reach the conclusion that you have to do this. If &quot;performance-aware&quot; people
squeak something about it, try to get them busy with something else, like implementing <tt>std::valarray</tt> to actually compile
to fast code using SIMD instructions of the host processor, without creating <a href="operator.html#fqa-13.10">temporary memory objects</a>. This should give you a couple of centuries long break.
</p>

<h2>[20.4] What happens in the hardware when I call a <tt>virtual</tt> function? How many layers of indirection are there? How much overhead is there?</h2>

<p>
<b class="FAQ"><a href="http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/virtual-functions.html#faq-20.4">FAQ:</a></b>
 There&#39;s a lot of code listings explaining the previous answer in detail.
</p>

<p>
<b class="FQA">FQA:</b> By &quot;hardware&quot;, you probably meant &quot;binary-level software&quot; - for each popular binary instruction encoding there are
lots of variants of processors implementing it, and the processors are integrated into many different systems with all kinds
of memory architectures. Even when you write <i>assembly code</i>, you can&#39;t tell exactly how it&#39;s going to be executed,
so of course you can&#39;t with a higher-level language which can be compiled to assembly in many different ways.
</p>

<p>
As to levels of indirections - typically there are two, one to fetch the vptr from the object and another one to fetch
the function from the vtable. One other approach could be to save a level of indirection by keeping the vtable
inside the object &quot;by value&quot; instead of &quot;by pointer&quot; - but that makes the objects larger.
</p>

<p>
As the proponents of <tt>virtual</tt> methods correctly point out, some overhead is inevitable in the situations where you use
a <tt>virtual</tt> function, because you don&#39;t know what function to call at compile time. Of course different ways to implement
the decision making can have slightly different performance characteristics on a given platform. If you care about such
tiny differences though, you probably have to fix it at a higher level (such as moving the decision outside of the innermost loop at the cost of possibly replicating some of the common code).
Fiddling with the low level - implementing the decision - is lots of boring work (rewrite, measure, rewrite, measure...) with
little gain.
</p>


<a name="fqa-20.5"></a>
<h2>[20.5] How can a member function in my derived class call the same function from its base class?</h2>

<p>
<b class="FAQ"><a href="http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/virtual-functions.html#faq-20.5">FAQ:</a></b>
 For some a reason, a pretty low-level discussion follows. Name mangling, &quot;call-by-name&quot; vs &quot;call-by-slot-number&quot;, code listings
                                          with double underscores...
</p>

<p>
<b class="FQA">FQA:</b> In a <tt>class Derived</tt>, in a function <tt>Derived::f()</tt>, you can type <tt>Base::f();</tt> to call the <tt>f</tt> implementation from
your base class <tt>Base</tt>. The compiler will ignore the actual type of your object (at the low level - vtable and all that),
and call <tt>Base::f</tt> just the way non-<tt>virtual</tt> functions are normally called.
</p>

<p>
I think you can do that in every OO language. It&#39;s pretty natural.
</p>


<a name="fqa-20.6"></a>
<h2>[20.6] I have a heterogeneous list of objects, and my code needs to do class-specific things to the objects. Seems like this ought to use dynamic binding but I can&#39;t figure it out. What should I do?</h2>

<p>
<b class="FAQ"><a href="http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/virtual-functions.html#faq-20.6">FAQ:</a></b>
 &quot;It&#39;s surprisingly easy&quot;, says the FAQ. This statement is followed by a surprisingly long answer.
</p>

<p>
<b class="FQA">FQA:</b> I don&#39;t know how &quot;surprising&quot; this is - that&#39;s the whole (the one and the only) point of polymorphism: to do
class-specific things to objects, without thinking how heterogeneous they are.
</p>

<p>
For this to work, have the classes
of those objects derive from a common base class (not extremely &quot;easy&quot; unless you planned ahead...). Then you can
run over the elements of <tt>std::list&lt;Base*&gt;</tt>, and call the virtual methods which do the class-specific things without
thinking about how many different classes the objects actually belong to, etc. For example:
</p>

<pre>
for(std::list&lt;Shape*&gt;::const_iterator p=shapes.begin(), e=shapes.end(); p!=e; ++p) {
  (*p)-&gt;draw(window);
}
</pre>

<p>
Off-topic: the STL way of saying <tt>foreach p in shapes</tt> is pretty ugly, isn&#39;t it?
</p>


<a name="fqa-20.7"></a>
<h2>[20.7] When should my destructor be <tt>virtual</tt>?</h2>

<p>
<b class="FAQ"><a href="http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/virtual-functions.html#faq-20.7">FAQ:</a></b>
 The rule of thumb is - when you have a <tt>virtual</tt> function. Strictly speaking, you need it when you want someone to be
able to derive classes from your class, create objects with <tt>new</tt>, and <tt>delete</tt> them via pointers to a base class.
</p>

<p>
<b class="FQA">FQA:</b> The situations when the rule of thumb is not good enough were not reported on our planet. Use this rule of thumb,
if only to suppress compiler warnings. Too bad the C++ compiler doesn&#39;t use the rule silently itself - it could
                           simply make the destructor <tt>virtual</tt> in these cases.
</p>


<a name="fqa-20.8"></a>
<h2>[20.8] What is a &quot;<tt>virtual</tt> constructor&quot;?</h2>

<p>
<b class="FAQ"><a href="http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/virtual-functions.html#faq-20.8">FAQ:</a></b>
 It&#39;s an idiom allowing you to have a pointer to a base class and use it to create objects of the right derived class.
You can implement it by providing <tt>virtual</tt> functions like these:
</p>

<pre>
virtual Base* create() const;
virtual Base* copy() const;
</pre>

<p>
You implement them like this:
</p>

<pre>
Derived* Derived::create() const { return new Derived; }
Derived* Derived::copy() const { return new Derived(*this); }
</pre>

<p>
Note that we return <tt>Derived*</tt>, not <tt>Base*</tt> - it&#39;s called &quot;Covariant Return Types&quot;. Some compilers have it, some don&#39;t.
</p>

<p>
<b class="FQA">FQA:</b> Other languages have built-in support for these things. This is interesting
because of the <i>other</i> things they make possible, like serialization (without writing special code for each class). Roughly, this is called &quot;reflection&quot;: you can find all
methods of a class at run-time, including those that are not normally called as <tt>virtual</tt>, such as constructors
(which can&#39;t be <tt>virtual</tt> - you have to create an object <i>before</i> you can dispatch function calls based on its type).
Another option is to (recursively) get the list of members of a class and create/copy them. It&#39;s hard to imagine
how useful this is if most of your programming experience comes from working with C++.
</p>

<p>
Covariant return types are a nice joke (for an admittedly narrow audience though). C++ lets you tighten the specification of return values - which is perfectly
legitimate: our base class said we should return a <tt>Base*</tt>, and we surely implement the contract if we always return
a <tt>Derived*</tt>, which is in particular a <tt>Base*</tt>. <i>But</i> C++ doesn&#39;t let you <i>loosen</i> the specification of arguments,
which can be shown to be legitimate for symmetrical reasons.
</p>

<p>
Why? Because C++ has overloading, so when you declare a <tt>virtual</tt> function which looks just like a function
from your base class, but has any kind of changes to argument types, C++ thinks you create a new unrelated <tt>virtual</tt> function
rather than override the one from the base class. Since C++ has no overloading based on the function return type,
there&#39;s no symmetrical problem.
</p>

<p>
C++ has lots of kinds of static typing, but little consistency between them.
To be fair, other languages have similar interactions between overloading and dynamic binding, and some probably
copied them from C++. However, other languages rarely encourage design which depends on the availability of overloading
to work (like STL), and/or is based on the microscopic details of overload resolution mechanisms (like some of the boost libraries).
