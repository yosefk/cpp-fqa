<h2>[33.1] Is the type of &quot;pointer-to-member-function&quot; different from &quot;pointer-to-function&quot;?</h2>

<p>
<b class="FAQ"><a href="http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/pointers-to-members.html#faq-33.1">FAQ:</a></b>
 It is.
</p>

<p>
If you have a non-member function <tt>void f(int)</tt>, then <tt>&amp;f</tt> is of type <tt>void (*)(int)</tt>.
</p>

<p>
If you have a non-<tt>static</tt> member function <tt>void C::f(int)</tt>, then <tt>&amp;C::f</tt> is of type <tt>void (C::*)(int)</tt>.
</p>

<p>
<b class="FQA">FQA:</b> Ahem.
<tt>::*)(</tt> - line noise creeps in. There&#39;s more of it in the rest of this section.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, the reason the types <i>should</i> be different is that a member function accepts a hidden
parameter - <tt>this</tt>. And the types of function pointers are derived from the types
      of the arguments and the return value. Obviously, the self-documenting bit of syntax <tt>C::*</tt>
      says that the function gets a <tt>this</tt>
      parameter of type <tt>C</tt>.
</p>


<a name="fqa-33.2"></a>
<h2>[33.2] How do I pass a pointer-to-member-function to a signal handler, X event callback, system call that starts a thread/task, etc?</h2>

<p>
<b class="FAQ"><a href="http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/pointers-to-members.html#faq-33.2">FAQ:</a></b>
 You don&#39;t. A member function can&#39;t be used without an object of the class, so the whole thing can&#39;t work.
What you can do is write a non-member function wrapping your pointer-to-member-function call.
</p>

<p>
For example,
      thread creation callbacks usually have a <tt>void*</tt> argument. You could pass an object pointer
      in that argument to the callback (which has to be a non-member). The callback would then cast the <tt>void*</tt> down to the actual type and call
      the object&#39;s method.
</p>

<p>
Some functions, like <tt>signal</tt>, use callbacks without a <tt>void*</tt> argument or anything similar. In that case, you have
      no choice but save a pointer to the object in a global variable. The callback can get the object
      pointer from that global variable and call the method.
</p>

<p>
<tt>static</tt> member functions <i>can</i> be used in the contexts where a C callback is expected, if
      they are <tt>extern &quot;C&quot;</tt>. Although on most compilers it would probably work without <tt>extern &quot;C&quot;</tt>,
      the standard says it doesn&#39;t have to work.
</p>

<p>
<b class="FQA">FQA:</b> The picture painted by the FAQ isn&#39;t very pretty, but the reality can get even worse - that is,
      more code to write. For example, you may want to call <i>any</i> method of an object - to select
      the method to call at run time, not compile time. <i>That</i> would really mean
      that you want to pass a pointer-to-member-function as a callback, which is what the question
      is all about. In the scenario in the FAQ,
      your problem is <i>passing the object pointer</i>, but there&#39;s actually <i>no pointer to a member function</i>.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, in this &quot;full-blown&quot; use case, passing just the object pointer via the
      <tt>void*</tt> argument is not enough. You&#39;d have to wrap the two pointers (the object pointer and the function pointer)
      in a structure, pass a <tt>void*</tt> to that structure to your callback and unpack the structure in that callback.
      Simple, but quite verbose. Pretty much like implementing function calls in assembly.
</p>

<p>
This illustrates the fact that C++ is a very low-level language. When you have a Python object <tt>obj</tt>
      with a method <tt>func</tt>, and you want someone expecting a callback to call <tt>obj.func()</tt>, you can create the callback object
      with the expression <tt>obj.func</tt>. As simple as that. In some high-level languages doing this is equally easy
      and in some it&#39;s more verbose, but <i>never, ever</i> would you have to save a pointer to your
      object to a global variable (and worry about making it thread-local when relevant, etc.).
</p>

<p>
The problem is that in C++, there&#39;s no single concept of a &quot;callable object&quot; - instead, there are <a href="function.html#fqa-33.7">unrelated</a>
      low-level mechanisms for calling functions. For example, non-member function pointers work differently
      from member function pointers. There are ubercompetent people out there who actually think they
      can get away with casting <tt>void (C::*p)(int)</tt> to type <tt>void (*)(C*,int)</tt>, because, you know,
      what we need is to pass <tt>this</tt> as the first parameter. This can work with many compilers, until
      you need to pass a pointer to a <tt>virtual</tt> function. Outsmarting compilers is usually dumb,
      especially C++ compilers. There really <i>is</i> more than one function call mechanism, and the different
      kinds of function pointer are not convertible - you have to implement adapters of varying
      degrees of clumsiness.
</p>

<p>
Regarding the <tt>static</tt>-members-as-callbacks issue: if your implementation uses different binary calling conventions for C functions and C++ <tt>static</tt> member
      functions, call the support and inform them that their developers consume mind-altering chemicals at work.
</p>


<a name="fqa-33.3"></a>
<h2>[33.3] Why do I keep getting compile errors (type mismatch) when I try to use a member function as an interrupt service routine?</h2>

<p>
<b class="FAQ"><a href="http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/pointers-to-members.html#faq-33.3">FAQ:</a></b>
 This is a special case of the <a href="function.html#fqa-33.2">previous</a> question.
</p>

<p>
<b class="FQA">FQA:</b> It is. So we&#39;ll use the opportunity to - surprise! - point out that handling interrupts in C++ can be done
      <i>just as well</i> as anything else. <i>Not much of a compliment</i>, really, but worth noting.
</p>

<p>
One of the problems
      with C++ is all the <i>unjustified</i> criticism. For example, some people will scream something like
      &quot;What?! Handling interrupts in C++?!&quot; - possibly followed by (false) claims about C++ being
      a &quot;high-level language&quot; (yeah, right) and maybe remarks about your mental health and stuff.
      These people don&#39;t know what they&#39;re talking about, and can make other people believe that C++
      only looks like a bad thing if one doesn&#39;t know what he&#39;s talking about.
</p>

<p>
Clarifications: of course you shouldn&#39;t throw exceptions in interrupt handlers, or call <tt>new</tt>, etc. Of course
      doing the job in C would be better, but this isn&#39;t special to interrupts. Of course
      many C++ features can do more damage when you <a href="operator.html#fqa-13.3">use them
      to talk to hardware</a> than elsewhere. All I&#39;m saying is that when you criticize something,
you either accompany your claims with some reasoning or you have no chance to convince people
      (at least not the ones worth the effort).
</p>


<a name="fqa-33.4"></a>
<h2>[33.4] Why am I having trouble taking the address of a C++ function?</h2>

<p>
<b class="FAQ"><a href="http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/pointers-to-members.html#faq-33.4">FAQ:</a></b>
 Mmmm, you&#39;re trying to take the address in order to use it as a C function pointer, aren&#39;t you? Well,
<a href="function.html#fqa-33.2">don't do that</a>.
      And don&#39;t try to cast your way out of this, it won&#39;t work.
</p>

<p>
<b class="FQA">FQA:</b> The FAQ didn&#39;t answer your question, did it? Instead, it assumed it knew what your problem was,
 and then answered a different question.
 Well, you could also ask your original question for a different reason.
 Specifically, you are already aware of the fact that <tt>&amp;C::f</tt> <a href="function.html#fqa-33.1">has a different type</a> than <tt>&amp;f</tt>, but you don&#39;t know
how to spell that type. So you&#39;re doing something semantically sensible, but you can&#39;t get the syntax right,
 because C++ has <a href="templates.html#fqa-35.16">so much syntax making so little sense</a>.
</p>

<p>
Well, I don&#39;t know the type of <tt>&amp;C::f</tt> either, because it depends on the arguments;
 I only know it&#39;s something like <tt>T1 (C::*)(T2,T3,T4)</tt>. So here&#39;s a way to find out the type of an arbitrary C++ expression:
</p>

<pre>
 template&lt;class T&gt;
 void show_type(const T&amp;)
 {
   int eat_flaming_death[-1];
 }
 void test_func()
 {
   show_type(&amp;C::f);  
 }
</pre>

<p>
The compiler will then say something like <tt>In void show_type&lt;TheTypeYouWantedToFigureOut&gt;(): arrays of negative size are not allowed</tt>.
In our case, <tt>TheTypeYouWantedToFigureOut</tt> will be substituted with the type of <tt>&amp;C::f</tt>.
</p>

<p>
Here&#39;s the best part: there&#39;s a large <a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/html/boost_staticassert.html">"compile time assertions"</a> movement promoting a plethora of arcane macros
 and templates which,
 like <tt>show_type</tt>, will cause the compiler to fail with an error message hopefully mentioning something
 related to the problem. This kind of thing is a <i>best practice</i> in C++. Isn&#39;t life amazing?
</p>


<a name="fqa-33.5"></a>
<h2>[33.5] How can I avoid syntax errors when calling a member function using a pointer-to-member-function?</h2>

<p>
<b class="FAQ"><a href="http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/pointers-to-members.html#faq-33.5">FAQ:</a></b>
 With a <tt>typedef</tt>, making the type name readable, and a <tt>#define</tt> macro, making the <tt>((obj).*(func))</tt> syntax readable.
 Ewww, macros are <a href="picture.html#fqa-6.15">evil</a>!
</p>

<p>
There were <i>hundreds</i> of postings to <tt>comp.lang.c++</tt> about this, says the FAQ. The layer of syntax proposed above
 could save the traffic.
</p>

<p>
<b class="FQA">FQA:</b> The FAQ actually proposes to use the old and oh-so-evil C macros to cover up the brand new syntax introduced in C++. The FQA
 will avoid further comments on this advice, since the target is too easy.
</p>

<p>
The amazing part about the hundreds of messages is not the fact that people can&#39;t get the C++ syntax right.
 The amazing part is the fact that people <i>wanted to use</i> pointers to member functions, despite the fact
 that they are pretty useless. What you really need quite frequently is &quot;delegates&quot; or &quot;functors&quot; or &quot;closures&quot; - well,
 anything that represents <i>both</i> the code (a function/an expression/...) and the data
 (an object/bound local variables/...). C++
 <a href="function.html#fqa-33.10">doesn't</a> support these things very well. Perhaps the <tt>comp.lang.c++</tt> posters tried to implement
  something like this on top of C++ object and member function pointers. Maybe even something generic,
  with templates inheriting from abstract base classes involved. Yeah, that sounds quite like
  the favorite pass-time of C++ developers.
</p>


<a name="fqa-33.6"></a>
<h2>[33.6] How do I create and use an array of pointer-to-member-function?</h2>

<p>
<b class="FAQ"><a href="http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/pointers-to-members.html#faq-33.6">FAQ:</a></b>
 First, <a href="function.html#fqa-33.5">add</a> a <tt>typedef</tt> and a macro. Then, use <tt>FuncPtrType arr[] = {&amp;C::f, &amp;C::g, &amp;C::h};</tt>
</p>

<p>
<b class="FQA">FQA:</b> Hey, why are we using an <a href="picture.html#fqa-6.15">evil</a> C array? Me not like this. How about:
</p>

<pre>
std::vector&lt;FuncPtrType&gt; arr;
arr.push_back(&amp;C::f);
arr.push_back(&amp;C::g);
arr.push_back(&amp;C::h);
</pre>

<p>
There, it&#39;s much better now. Wait till you see the full type name of <tt>arr</tt> in a <a href="templates.html#fqa-35.17">compiler error message</a>.
</p>


<a name="fqa-33.7"></a>
<h2>[33.7] Can I convert a pointer-to-member-function to a <tt>void*</tt>?</h2>

<p>
<b class="FAQ"><a href="http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/pointers-to-members.html#faq-33.7">FAQ:</a></b>
 No, and if it seems to work on some platform, it doesn&#39;t make it legal.
</p>

<p>
<b class="FQA">FQA:</b> Listen to the FAQ. This isn&#39;t just language lawyer talk - it <i>really</i> isn&#39;t going to work.
  Check out <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/cpp/FastDelegate.asp">this article</a> - it has a lot of material
  on C++ member function pointers. <b>WARNING:</b> this stuff can be used to scare little children.
</p>

<p>
The bottom line is that unlike a global function pointer,
 a member function pointer is not just the address of the first instruction of the function in most implementations,
  apparently with the exception of the compiler by <a href="http://www.digitalmars.com/">Digital Mars</a>
  (the company behind <a href="http://www.digitalmars.com/d/index.html">the D language</a>). That compiler generates &quot;thunk code&quot; which handles the differences
  between various dispatching mechanisms (<tt>virtual</tt> vs. statically dispatched functions, different kinds of inheritance),
  and uses the address of that thunk code to represent member function pointers. Quote from the article
  about this implementation: &quot;Why doesn&#39;t everyone else do it this way?&quot;
</p>

<p>
So, really, don&#39;t cast these things to <tt>void*</tt> - you can&#39;t even sensibly cast them to non-member function pointers.
</p>


<a name="fqa-33.8"></a>
<h2>[33.8] Can I convert a pointer-to-function to a <tt>void*</tt>?</h2>

<p>
<b class="FAQ"><a href="http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/pointers-to-members.html#faq-33.8">FAQ:</a></b>
 Stop that. No. And don&#39;t tell me it worked for you. It&#39;s illegal.
</p>

<p>
<b class="FQA">FQA:</b> C and C++ strongly separate between code and data (so do many languages and hardware processor implementations).
  A pointer to a data object is not the same as a pointer to a function. However, in the vast majority of implementations
  their sizes are going to be the same, so it&#39;s possible to convert a function pointer to a <tt>void*</tt>, and
  then somewhere else convert it back and call the function.
</p>

<p>
This violates the language rules. So does code assuming 2&#39;s complement integers and IEEE floating point.
  The chance of both kinds of code to actually fail on an interesting platform is low. Admittedly, the
  code-pointers-are-just-like-data-pointers assumption is less useful than
  the signed-numbers-can-be-divided-using-right-shift assumption, though.
  So typically one wouldn&#39;t do this kind of cast, after all.
</p>


<a name="fqa-33.9"></a>
<h2>[33.9] I need something like function-pointers, but with more flexibility and/or thread-safety; is there another way?</h2>

<p>
<b class="FAQ"><a href="http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/pointers-to-members.html#faq-33.9">FAQ:</a></b>
 A functionoid is what you need.
</p>

<p>
<b class="FQA">FQA:</b> &quot;Functionoid&quot; rhymes with <a href="http://foldoc.org/?marketroid">"marketroid"</a>, and is a term local to the FAQ,
  used instead of the standard term
  <a href="function.html#fqa-33.10">"functor"</a>.
</p>


<a name="fqa-33.10"></a>
<h2>[33.10] What the heck is a functionoid, and why would I use one?</h2>

<p>
<b class="FAQ"><a href="http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/pointers-to-members.html#faq-33.10">FAQ:</a></b>
 It means &quot;a function on steroids&quot;, of course. The FAQ goes on to describe a class with a single <tt>virtual</tt> function
  called <tt>doit</tt>. An object of this class is basically just like a function except you can pass it arguments in its constructor,
  and it can keep state between calls without thread-unsafe global variables. The discussion is very lengthy and didactic, there are lots of
  examples. If you didn&#39;t say to yourself something like &quot;Oh, yeah, that problem&quot;, you can follow the link
to the real FAQ&#39;s answer to see what this is all about.
</p>

<p>
<b class="FQA">FQA:</b> A &quot;functionoid&quot;
(or functor, as it&#39;s normally called) is basically a manual emulation of
 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(computer_science)">closures</a>. Closures can save all those little
 classes people create in order to have a function-pointer-plus-some-context. For example,
 the following code, which tries to use a higher-order function (<tt>for_each</tt>) in a language without
 closures (C++), is completely ridiculous:
</p>

<pre>
struct Printer
{
  std::ostream&amp; out;
  Printer(std::ostream&amp; o) : out(o) {}
  template&lt;class T&gt;
  void operator()(const T&amp; x) const { out&lt;&lt;x&lt;&lt;std::endl; }
};
void print_them(const std::vector&lt;int&gt;&amp; them)
{
  std::for_each(them.begin(), them.end(), Printer(std::cout));
}
</pre>

<p>
Clearly, a <tt>for</tt> loop wouldn&#39;t be nearly as bad. However, if we had closures, we could do something like this:
</p>

<pre>
void print_them(const std::vector&lt;int&gt;&amp; them)
{
  std::for_each(them.begin(), them.end(), lambda(x) { std::cout &lt;&lt; x &lt;&lt; std::endl; });
}
</pre>

<p>
This would still be verbose because of smaller problems (<tt>std::</tt>, mentioning <tt>them</tt> twice),
 but at least the stupid <tt>Printer</tt> class is now replaced with code generated implicitly by the compiler.
</p>

<p>
Check out the monstrous <a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/html/lambda.html">boost lambda library</a> designed to work around the lack of closures in C++
 in a desperate attempt to make higher-level functions of the kind defined at <tt>&lt;algorithm&gt;</tt> not
 entirely useless. When I tried it, <tt>gcc</tt> wouldn&#39;t compile it without <tt>-ftemplate-depth=40</tt>
 (the default template nesting depth limit, 17, is not enough for this library),
 and I got <i>5 screens</i> of error messages from <i>a single line of code using the thing</i>. See also <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.c++.moderated/browse_thread/thread/100dd325c6d9ef77/a4444dc5dc9d94c0">this thread</a>,
 especially the part where they explain how <tt>cout &lt;&lt; _1 &lt;&lt; endl</tt> works
 but <tt>cout &lt;&lt; &quot;\t&quot; &lt;&lt; _1 &lt;&lt; endl</tt> doesn&#39;t (to get there quick, search for &quot;fails miserably&quot;, then continue to the reply).

<h2>[33.11] Can you make functionoids faster than normal function calls?</h2>

<p>
<b class="FAQ"><a href="http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/pointers-to-members.html#faq-33.11">FAQ:</a></b>
 Sure! Instead of <tt>virtual</tt> functions, use <tt>inline</tt> member functions and make the code using the
 &quot;functionoid&quot; a template.
</p>

<p>
<b class="FQA">FQA:</b> This way the &quot;functionoid&quot; will compile slower than &quot;normal function calls&quot; though, not to mention
 the loss of flexibility at run time.
 The run time speed impact of the obsolete approach to inlining used by C++ is discussed <a href="inline.html#fqa-9.3">here</a>.
 The compile time speed impact of C++ templates is discussed <a href="templates.html#fqa-35.12">here</a>.
 The fact that it&#39;s <i>your</i> job to make sure things are inlined properly in this family of scenarios
