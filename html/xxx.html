<h1>&iuml;&raquo;&iquest;C++ criticism by other people</h1>
<small class="part">Part of <a href="index.html">C++ FQA
Lite</a></small>
<hr>
<p>This page is a collection of the best C++ criticism by FQA
readers, copied from e-mail messages and online discussions. If you
know an interesting consequence of C++ problems not mentioned in
the FQA, please <a href="http://yosefk.com">send me e-mail</a>.
Similarly to <a href="http://yosefk.com/c++fqa/web-vs-fqa.html">the
FQA errors</a> page, this one lists things that can be proved /
tested rather than qualitative statements. The stuff is published
with credits or anonymously, according to the choice of each
author.</p>
<p>The issues listed here (or the FQA itself) are not supposed to
be "new" in the sense that they were never discussed in a published
work (if C++ problems were so hard to discover as to take decades,
discussing them wouldn't necessarily be worth the trouble).</p>
<p>There's lots of (well-reasoned or entertaining or both) C++
criticism on the web, including several pieces by celebrity
programmers. However, I made the decision not to cite famous quotes
by celebrities on this site. The main reason is that I don't want
to make the FQA more convincing to the people who mostly value the
credentials of an author and ignore things like facts and
reasoning. I want to work less both with C++ <i>and</i> with these
people. So I'd rather have them use C++ than convince them to
switch to something else.</p>

<h2>Implicit type conversions</h2>
<p><i>Anonymous:</i> I'd add something about the broken type system
- how the following code is legal and compiles without warnings
with most compilers, for example:</p>
<pre>
void foo(const std::string &amp;) {}
int main() 
{
    foo(false);
}
</pre>
<p>Another example:</p>
<pre>
class A { public: int a; };
class B : public A { public: int b; };
int main() 
{
    A * p = new B[10];
    p[5].a = 1;
}
</pre>
<p>Why should a static type system allow this without an explicit
cast?</p>
<p><i>Yossi:</i> The FQA doesn't talk much about implicit type
conversions, since the FAQ doesn't. The problem is quite important
though. It wouldn't be so bad if C++ detected run time errors (as
opposed to compiling the second example to code modifying the wrong
place), and/or if so many C++ programmers didn't think that "with
C++, when it compiles and links, it will run correctly" (I actually
heard this one, and then there are many large C++ monolithic
applications without unit tests speaking for themselves).</p>
<p>Note that this has nothing to do with safety and C++ being a
"power tool allowing you to do dangerous things" because it's so
"high-performance". This argument only makes sense for
<i>explicit</i> casts. What the code demonstrates is unexpected
interactions between pairs of different implicit conversions (in
the first example, <tt>bool -&gt; char* -&gt; std::string</tt>, in
the second - <tt>B[] -&gt; B* -&gt; A*</tt>).</p>
<p>By the way, the second example explains <a href=
"inheritance-proper.html#fqa-21.5">the FAQ's remark</a> about
arrays being <a href="picture.html#fqa-6.15">evil</a> in the
context of inheritance and substitutability. The thing is that with
arrays of objects, there's an implicit type conversion that allows
you to violate the substitutability principle without a compile
time error. With <tt>std::vector&lt;B&gt;</tt>, there's no implicit
cast. I didn't understand the FAQ was talking about that, because
most of the time, when inheritance and polymorphism are involved,
you allocate arrays of <i>pointers</i> to objects. And in that
case, there's no difference between a <tt>vector&lt;B*&gt;</tt> and
a <tt>B**</tt> - you'd need an explicit cast in both cases. I
automatically thought the question was the continuation of the
discussion in <a href="inheritance-proper.html#fqa-21.2">preceding
questions</a> about <i>why</i> the compiler wouldn't do the cast
implicitly, and in that context the "arrays are evil" remark didn't
quite fit. I completely forgot about the arrays-of-objects case,
which is something a newbie coming from another language (and with
C++, some people stay "newbies" for years) could very well try to
use.</p>

<h2>C++ grammar: the type name vs object name issue</h2>
<p><i>drorz:</i> In C/C++ you can not separate parsing into
separate syntax and semantic passes. No existing compiler does it
in two separate passes.</p>
<p>In the example:</p>
<pre>
AA BB(CC);
</pre>
<p>The parse tree is different in the following cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>When AA and CC are types, BB is a function prototype.</li>
<li>When AA is a type and CC is a variable, then BB is a
variable/object initialization.</li>
<li>When AA is a variable, <tt>AA BB(CC)</tt> is illegal and its
parse tree is entirely different from the first two cases.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can not (more precisely, no one did it in a real C/C++
compiler) fix a wrong parse tree in semantic analysis pass.</p>
<p>Consider this example:</p>
<pre>
x * y(z);
</pre>
<p>in two different contexts:</p>
<pre>
int main() {
    int x, y(int), z;
    x * y(z);
}
</pre>
<p>and</p>
<pre>
int main() {
    struct x { x(int) {} } *z;
    x * y(z);
}
</pre>
<p>In the first case <tt>x * y(z)</tt> is expression, and in the
second case it is a declaration of pointer y. Parse trees for those
cases are completely different.</p>
<p><i>Yossi:</i> This is the first part of the problem making the
C++ grammar undecidable. The second part of the problem is that
<tt>AA</tt> may really be
<tt>Template&lt;Params&gt;::InnerDef</tt>, and figuring out whether
<tt>InnerDef</tt> is a type name or an object name is equivalent to
solving the halting problem, since templates may instantiate
themselves recursively and in fact represent arbitrary recursive
functions. Maybe I'll expand on this one later. In particular, it
has to do with template specializations, which are discussed in the
next item.</p>
<p>Purists who don't like the "nearly context-free" expression in
Defective C++: when you write parsers, it <i>does</i> make sense to
discuss the "extent" of your dependence on the context. For
example, C++ inherits the type name/object name riddle from C. But
in C, you can solve it using a single dictionary of
<tt>typedef</tt> names. Of course, theoretically the important part
is that the C grammar is <i>decidable</i> (though not
context-free). In practice, what matters is that it's <i>easy to
parse</i>. In particular, you can use a parser generator for
context-free grammars (<tt>yacc</tt>/<tt>bison</tt> is one mature
program in this family) with the simple "symbol table hack"
described above, and get a working parser. This is what "nearly
context-free" means.</p>
<p>I think the example is excellent since it took me quite some
time to figure out what the code means myself (I think it's the
asterisk). The <tt>AA BB(CC);</tt> example used in Defective C++ is
simpler, but I think it doesn't convey the point as clearly, since
apparently it makes it intuitively easier to counter with something
like "you can solve the ambiguity at the semantical analysis
stage". Note that you can <i>always</i> counter with that - for
example, you can say that the "parse tree" of your language is
simply the list of characters in the file, and the rest is
semantical analysis.</p>

<h2>C++ grammar: type vs object and template specializations</h2>
<p><i>drorz:</i> Consider the following example:</p>
<pre>
  
#include &lt;cstdio&gt;
template&lt;int n&gt; struct confusing
{
    static int q;
};
template&lt;&gt; struct confusing&lt;1&gt;
{
    template&lt;int n&gt;
    struct q
    {
        q(int x)
        {
            printf("Separated syntax and semantics.\n");
        }
        operator int () { return 0; }
    };
};
char x;
int main()
{
    int x = confusing&lt;sizeof(x)&gt;::q &lt; 3 &gt; (2);
    return 0;
}
</pre>
<p>If you "didn't care" about semantics during parsing, then
<tt>confusing&lt;1&gt;::q</tt> is a typename, so
<tt>confusing&lt;1&gt;::q&lt;3&gt;(2)</tt> creates an object of
type <tt>confusing&lt;1&gt;::q&lt;3&gt;</tt> with the argument
2.</p>
<p>If you "do" semantics during the syntax pass, then
<tt>confusing&lt;4&gt;</tt> will be looked up,
<tt>confusing&lt;4&gt;::q</tt> is a variable. The declaration would
"expand" to <tt>int x = (confusing&lt;4&gt;::q &lt; 3) &gt;
2</tt>.</p>
<p>You can see that parse trees in those cases are completely
different, based on the output of the <tt>sizeof</tt> operator!</p>
<p><i>Yossi:</i> ...and <tt>sizeof</tt> depends on the platform and
the implementation details of inheritance (including multiple and
virtual), virtual functions, etc. The "parser" gets closer and
closer to a full-blown compiler.</p>
<p>The problem is the freedom that template specializations have
when defining members. Now if anybody showed me a <i>useful</i>
application of the ability to define something as an inner type in
one specialization and a static variable in some other
specialization, I'd be surprised.</p>
<p>The <a href=
"http://programming.reddit.com/info/5z7jr/comments/c02bmog">reddit
thread</a> which this and the previous example are taken from has a
detailed discussion about parsing C++.</p>
<p><a name="misfeature-4" id="misfeature-4"></a></p>
<h2>printf, iostream and internationalization</h2>
<p><i>Alexander E. Patrakov (patrakov at ums dot usu dot ru):</i>
The FQA lists <a href="io.html#fqa-15.1">valid information</a> for
and against the use of <tt>&lt;iostream&gt;</tt> instead of
<tt>&lt;cstdio&gt;</tt>. There is, however, one more thing for
<tt>&lt;cstdio&gt;</tt> and against <tt>&lt;iostream&gt;</tt>: the
possibility to translate program messages to a different natural
language (using, e.g., <tt>gettext</tt>). And here I don't mean
that there is currently no gettext equivalent for C++ iostreams,
but that there is no way to design such thing correctly.</p>
<p>Translation works on phrases, not on their parts. Consider,
e.g., such C statements:</p>
<pre>
printf("Read %d files\n", total);
printf("New data were found in %d files\n", found);
</pre>
<p>With the standard C++ iostreams, this becomes:</p>
<pre>
cout &lt;&lt; "Read " &lt;&lt; total &lt;&lt; " files\n";
cout &lt;&lt; "New data were found in " &lt;&lt; found &lt;&lt; " files\n";
</pre>
<p>A well-designed program fetches translations from a message
catalog, Windows resource or anywhere else except its own source
code. With C and gettext message catalogs, the translator sees the
whole phrases such as <i>"Read %d files", "New data were found in
%d files"</i>, etc. If the same approach were applied to C++, the
translator would see just <i>"Read ", "New data were found in
"</i>, and <i>"files"</i> (used twice). Lack of context is the
least of all worries. The real problem is that, e.g., when
translating to Russian, the two instances of " files" have to be
translated slightly differently, because Russian has six
grammatical cases and different cases are required in the two
sentences:</p>
<pre>
Read %d files =&gt; &ETH;&Yuml;&Ntilde;&euro;&ETH;&frac34;&Ntilde;&Dagger;&ETH;&cedil;&Ntilde;&sbquo;&ETH;&deg;&ETH;&frac12;&ETH;&frac34; %d &Ntilde;&bdquo;&ETH;&deg;&ETH;&sup1;&ETH;&raquo;&ETH;&frac34;&ETH;&sup2;
New data were found in %d files =&gt; &ETH;&ETH;&frac34;&ETH;&sup2;&Ntilde;&lsaquo;&ETH;&micro; &ETH;&acute;&ETH;&deg;&ETH;&frac12;&ETH;&frac12;&Ntilde;&lsaquo;&ETH;&micro; &ETH;&plusmn;&Ntilde;&lsaquo;&ETH;&raquo;&ETH;&cedil; &ETH;&frac12;&ETH;&deg;&ETH;&sup1;&ETH;&acute;&ETH;&micro;&ETH;&frac12;&Ntilde;&lsaquo; &ETH;&sup2; %d &Ntilde;&bdquo;&ETH;&deg;&ETH;&sup1;&ETH;&raquo;&ETH;&deg;&Ntilde;&hellip;
</pre>
<p>(approximately - I don't want to overwhelm the example with the
singular/plural treatment)</p>
<p>Even worse, examples exist with two format substitutions where
they have to be reordered when translating. C (or, more precisely,
the Single UNIX Specification) allows such reordering with
something like <tt>printf("%2$d x %1$d inches", width, num);</tt>
but in C++ the output order of fields is hard-coded.</p>
<p>The downside is, of course, that nobody except the translator
checks the translated format string, and wrongly-copied conversion
specifiers can crash a program in the corresponding locale (and
this did happen with sed and vim in the past).</p>
<p>See how Trolltech <a href=
"http://doc.trolltech.com/4.3/i18n.html#use-qstring-arg-for-dynamic-text">
handles</a> the abovementioned problems in their Qt toolkit.</p>
<p><i>Yossi:</i> I really like this example because it can be a
real eye-opener for a practical programmer, and I wish I heard and
thought about it several years ago. Clearly the <tt>printf</tt>
interface gets something right that <tt>iostream</tt> doesn't,
since it seems to save us lots of trouble. What is it that
<tt>printf</tt> gets right? Could it be that representing the
program structure using compile time constructs incomprehensible to
any tool except for the compiler is not the way to go? Effectively
the advantage of the <tt>printf</tt> program is that it's easier
for <i>other programs</i> to manipulate. The idea that backfires is
that program structure may be encoded in abitrarily complex ways
and the only one who ever has to worry about it is the compiler
writer.</p>
<p>But maybe this translation business is a singularity in the
computing universe, and we shouldn't infer general conclusions from
it? Well, here's another example. Suppose you want to do real time
logging. You don't have enough time and/or bandwidth to do the
formatting at the target machine. And yet you want to log free
text, not some strict binary format with versioning schemes and
fixed size limits and other headaches. With <tt>printf</tt>-style
interface, you can log packets of (for example) 32 bit words -
size, constant format string pointer, and the list of arguments.
You can then extract the format strings from the executable file
(reading ELF or COFF files is easy - there are examples on the net
of about 200 lines of C code), and do the formatting at the host
machine. Now, with <tt>iostream</tt>-like interface, the format
string is split to many little parts, and all kinds of types come
in the middle - types of data items have to be encoded in the
logged packets, too. And you'd have to log calls to I/O
manipulators such as <tt>hex</tt>, <tt>setfill</tt>, etc. Clearly
the overhead per logged data word is going to increase
significantly.</p>
<p>Think about it: how can it be that a simplistic "1 format string
plus N arguments of dynamic types" interface beats an advanced
"statically dispatched polymorphic operators" interface, and what
makes it surprising to you?</p>

<h2>Static binding rules</h2>
<p><i>Miguel Catalina:</i> The following test program does not
compile under gcc 4.3.{1,2}:</p>
<pre>
#include &lt;cmath&gt;
struct my_class {
  my_class(int) {}
};
inline my_class operator&amp;&amp;(my_class,int){return my_class(0);}
int main(void)
{
  double x = std::pow(1.0, 1.0);
  (void) x;  to avoid unused variable warning
}
</pre>
<p>The error message is:</p>
<pre>
$ g++ -Wall -pedantic-errors simple_test.cpp
simple_test.cpp: In function &acirc;&euro;&tilde;int main()&acirc;&euro;&trade;:
simple_test.cpp:11: error: ambiguous overload for operator&amp;&amp;' in std::__traitor&lt;std::__is_integer&lt;double&gt;, std::__is_floating&lt;double&gt; &gt;::__value &amp;&amp; std::__traitor&lt;std::__is_integer&lt;double&gt;, std::__is_floating&lt;double&gt; &gt;::__value'
simple_test.cpp:11: note: candidates are: operator&amp;&amp;(bool, bool) &lt;built-in&gt;
simple_test.cpp:7: note:                 my_class operator&amp;&amp;(my_class, int)
</pre>
<p>The reason for this error has to do with this declaration in
<tt>cmath</tt>:</p>
<pre>
  template&lt;typename _Tp, typename _Up&gt;
    inline
    typename __gnu_cxx::__promote_2&lt;
    typename __gnu_cxx::__enable_if&lt;__is_arithmetic&lt;_Tp&gt;::__value
                                    &amp;&amp; __is_arithmetic&lt;_Up&gt;::__value,
                                    _Tp&gt;::__type, _Up&gt;::__type
    pow(_Tp __x, _Up __y)
    {
      typedef typename __gnu_cxx::__promote_2&lt;_Tp, _Up&gt;::__type __type;
      return pow(__type(__x), __type(__y));
    }
</pre>
<p>Tracing a few header files up brings us to
<tt>bits/cpp_type_traits.h</tt>:</p>
<pre>
  template&lt;typename _Tp&gt;
    struct __is_arithmetic
    : public __traitor&lt;__is_integer&lt;_Tp&gt;, __is_floating&lt;_Tp&gt; &gt;
    { };
</pre>
<p>...and:</p>
<pre>
  template&lt;class _Sp, class _Tp&gt;
    struct __traitor
    {
      enum { __value = bool(_Sp::__value)  bool(_Tp::__value) };
      typedef typename __truth_type&lt;__value&gt;::__type __type;
    };
</pre>
<p>So it turns out that the operation that is giving us trouble is
the &amp;&amp; inside the <tt>__enable_if</tt> in the template
declaration of <tt>pow()</tt>. We are invoking &amp;&amp; with two
<tt>enum</tt> operands (<tt>__is_arithmetic&lt;T&gt;::__value</tt>
is an unnamed <tt>enum</tt>). I guess the compiler is treating
unnamed <tt>enum</tt>s as <tt>int</tt>s. So the compiler is trying
to call <tt>operator&amp;&amp;(int,int)</tt>. But there isn't,
there are only <tt>operator&amp;&amp;(my_class,int)</tt> and
<tt>operator&amp;&amp;(bool,bool)</tt>. So the compiler is trying
to do an implicit conversion of the operands so that they can match
the available prototypes. There are implicit ways of converting an
<tt>int</tt> to a <tt>my_class</tt>, as well as convering an
<tt>int</tt> to a <tt>bool</tt>. The compiler does not know which
one to use, hence the ambiguity.</p>
<p>The question is: why on Earth when you are trying to invoke a
function that only deals with <tt>double</tt>s, do you have to deal
with the ambiguity between two available implicit conversions for
types that have nothing to do with <tt>double</tt>?</p>
<p><i>Yossi:</i> Takes time to wrap one's mind around this, um,
treason (don't you just love the <tt>public __traitor</tt> bit? I
guess a "traitor" is something used to generate so-called "type
traits", a key idiom in the world of C++ templates arcana). Now
that we (presumably) understand the error message, how would you
work around the problem? If the compiler would barf trying to
dispatch an operator with user-defined types, we could specifically
define the operator with the prototype it would pick as the best
match (as the GNU STL implementors themselves <a href=
"templates.html#fqa-35.11">do</a> in similar situations). But we
can't define <tt>operator&amp;&amp;(int,int)</tt>. Now what?</p>
