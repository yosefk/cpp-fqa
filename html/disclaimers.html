<h1>Disclaimers and excuses</h1>
<small class="part">Part of <a href="index.html">C++ FQA Lite</a></small><hr>

<p>
This page lists a bunch of disclaimers and excuses, in no particular order.
</p>

<p>
I know C++ better than it deserves, but I could make errors. If you find some, I&#39;d be grateful if you told me.
</p>

<p>
The same goes for English, except for the &quot;better than it deserves&quot; part.
</p>

<p>
It is technically possible to write &quot;good&quot; code in C++, for many reasonable definitions of &quot;good&quot;.
Choosing <a href="inheritance-multiple.html#fqa-25.3">not to work on a project</a> just because it uses C++ may be a dumb decision.
Criticizing software just because it&#39;s written in C++ is not very bright, either.
</p>

<p>
Throughout the FQA, there are <a href="picture.html#fqa-6.2">places</a> where the text <a href="class.html#fqa-7.5">passionately argues</a> with people
vaguely defined as &quot;C++ promoters&quot; or the like. This is supposed to be purely rhetorical.
I can&#39;t and shouldn&#39;t judge the intentions, the competence or any other personal traits of real people somehow
related to C++.
</p>

<p>
It&#39;s the same with the criticism of &quot;C++ users&quot;. For the record,
some of my knowledge of C++ was obtained through rather time consuming experimentation, performed
under the wrong assumption that it <i>has</i> to pay off when I finally plug all the holes.
The purpose of this confession is to
show one reason I have to avoid personally offending people desperately trying to make C++ do something useful.
</p>

<p>
The FQA&#39;s answers to the &quot;frequently asked questions&quot; typically argue with the FAQ&#39;s answers.
This only has a chance to be interesting when the FAQ&#39;s position represents the opinions
of a large subset of the C++ devotees out there. Which is probably not always true.
</p>

<p>
I couldn&#39;t directly quote
the FAQ&#39;s answers in order to argue with them (Marshall Cline, the FAQ author, didn&#39;t respond to my request regarding this).
So I summarized the answers instead.
My summaries had to be biased no matter what I did, so I made the bias fairly explicit.
I hope the links to
the original compensate for the loss of information, although I did try to make most
of my summaries informative, not just biased. I also recommend to check out the original
answers - some of them can be quite entertaining, and some may do a great job convincing
you that <i>something is deeply wrong with the C++ community</i>.
I quoted the questions themselves verbatim, under the assumption that they are not
copyrighted work of any specific person, since they are, after all, asked frequently.
</p>

<p>
The FQA doesn&#39;t show examples of code written in programming languages other than C and C++.
I believe that for any new project, there&#39;s a much better language than C++. Moreover,
that language can be virtually any of the languages popular today if it&#39;s compatible with
the basic requirements imposed by the problem domain. I didn&#39;t want to put any emphasis
on a particular alternative to C++, because choosing one is largely a matter of taste;
writing and testing examples in many languages felt like too much work.
I singled out C as the single explicitly mentioned alternative to C++ because I find
that its superiority to C++ is pretty funny considering the circumstances.
However, in many cases I mention &quot;other languages&quot; which have things C doesn&#39;t have
(safe execution, reflection, etc.);
typically, I refer to Python/Ruby/..., Java/C#/..., and Lisp/Scheme/... families
of languages in those places. All these languages run in managed environments; if you
choose to sacrifice safety for performance, check out the D language.
</p>

<p>
Several FAQ sections are omitted. Some of those don&#39;t talk about C++ features, some repeat stuff mentioned
in other sections, and some deal with things discussing which wouldn&#39;t add anything new to the FQA
(for example, <tt>private</tt> inheritance - the FQA talks quite a lot about <a href="class.html#fqa-7.4">C++ access control</a> already).
On the other hand, the FQA does repeat itself in many places.
</p>

<p>
The opinions in the FQA are my own, and are not supposed to represent the opinions of
anybody else.
</p>

<p>
Finally, the following sentence is only here to attract a certain set of search engine
users interested in our subject, and should not be interpreted as the summary of my point of view
on the complicated issues discussed:
</p>

<p>
C++ SUCKS
