<h2>[17.1] What are some ways <tt>try / catch / throw</tt> can improve software quality?</h2>

<p>
<b class="FAQ"><a href="http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/exceptions.html#faq-17.1">FAQ:</a></b>
 You&#39;ll have less <tt>if</tt> statements in your code: you won&#39;t have to check for errors
each time you call a function. Conditional statements are known to contain
more bugs than other statements. With less <tt>if</tt> tests, you&#39;ll ship a better product, faster.
</p>

<p>
<b class="FQA">FQA:</b> This is <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult>cargo cult</a> programming. Conditional
statements are error-prone because they are used to handle complicated scenarios, where an action
can result in many different outcomes, which affect the next actions. In order to make errors less probable, one has to simplify
the model of the desired behavior of the software. The problem is the complexity that leads to <tt>if</tt>
statements, not the <tt>if</tt> keyword, and using different keywords is not going to solve the problem by itself.
</p>

<p>
Exceptions are supposed to simplify the error handling model based on the assumption that in most cases,
a function that detected an error can&#39;t handle it, and has to propagate it to the caller. Finally,
a &quot;high-level&quot; enough caller is reached and actually makes a decision (pops up an error message, tries a different
action, etc.).
</p>

<p>
Despite its promises, this approach has inherent problems. There&#39;s a &quot;social&quot; problem -
with exceptions, people are not aware of the different errors that may happen in the code because most
of the code doesn&#39;t deal with errors. And when people rarely think about a particular aspect of an application,
ultimately this aspect is unlikely to be handled well. There&#39;s a more &quot;technical&quot; problem - functions essentially
doing nothing upon error except for propagating errors to the caller still can&#39;t be completely unaware of errors.
That&#39;s because they may need to release the resources they acquired before returning to the caller, which
may lead to <i>more</i> errors, which must also be handled. Finally, in practice exception support has run-time overhead, and very
significant code size overhead, even if exceptions are never raised at run time, and even if they are <i>not mentioned</i> in your code.
C++ devotees may claim otherwise; you can check by compiling your code with and without exception support (if your compiler
doesn&#39;t have such a flag, compile code as C and as C++ instead). This is unacceptable in resource-constrained systems.
</p>

<p>
Still, in many cases, the benefits of exceptions are more important than their problems. For example, if your
language manages memory automatically, the problem of releasing acquired resources becomes a small one (you only
have to care about files, etc., which are a tiny part of the &quot;resources&quot; used by a program - most of the
&quot;resources&quot; are memory). If your language throws exceptions when you violate its rules (for example, upon
out-of-bounds array access), these exceptions will help you find lots of bugs, especially if you can get the call stack
from an exception. If the purpose of an application is automated testing, and/or it&#39;s used as a quick-and-dirty
internal tool as opposed to a product for an end user, this kind of exceptions is all you need to handle errors of
almost all kinds. In some languages, you can even resume the execution from the point where the exception was
raised after fixing the problem at the point where it was caught.
</p>

<p>
C++ exceptions offer none of these features. &quot;Exception-safe&quot; C++ code <a href="exceptions.html#fqa-17.3">can't handle errors</a> which happen
when it tries to release resources; &quot;exception-unsafe&quot; C++ code will <a href="heap.html#fqa-16.1">leak</a> resources, most frequently memory; and once you throw
an exception, the call stack is <a href="exceptions.html#fqa-17.7">lost</a>. This means that even separating your code to several processes and executing
code like <tt>*(int*)0 = 0;</tt> upon error is a better way to handle errors than C++ exceptions: at least the memory
is going to be reclaimed by the operating system, and you can typically have it save a snapshot of the process,
so that you can open it in a debugger and see where the error happened. A recommendation to &quot;ban&quot; exceptions
is probably over the edge, but think <i>a lot</i> before using C++ exceptions, <i>or</i> a feature that implicitly depends
on them, such as <a href="exceptions.html#fqa-17.2">constructors</a> and <a href="operator.html#fqa-13.1">overloaded operators</a>, which have no other way to report an error. What C++ calls
&quot;exceptions&quot; is as unlikely to give you the benefits people get from exceptions in other languages as what
C++ calls &quot;classes&quot; is <a href="class.html#fqa-7.1">unlikely</a> to give you the benefits of OO.

<h2>[17.2] How can I handle a constructor that fails?</h2>

<p>
<b class="FAQ"><a href="http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/exceptions.html#faq-17.2">FAQ:</a></b>
 As you&#39;d guess from the location of this question in the FAQ, the answer is &quot;by throwing an exception&quot;. Alternatively,
you can mark the object as a &quot;zombie&quot; by using some kind of validity flag. You can then check that flag in the
calling code and maybe in the member functions of the object. The latter solution tends to &quot;get ugly&quot;.
</p>

<p>
<b class="FQA">FQA:</b> The inability to gracefully handle errors in C++ constructors is one good reason to <a href="ctors.html#fqa-10.17">avoid</a> constructors
that do more than nothing, and use initialization functions instead. And C++ exceptions are not a graceful way to
handle errors, <i>especially</i> in constructors. If your member object constructor throws an exception,
and you want to catch it in your constructor, the normally <a href="ctors.html#fqa-10.6">ugly</a> colon syntax gets much uglier.
</p>

<p>
By the way, the C++ standard library doesn&#39;t throw exceptions in constructors (except for the ones thrown by
<tt>operator new</tt>). For example, you are supposed to test whether <tt>ofstream</tt> objects are zombies when you pass
them a filename in the constructor.
</p>


<a name="fqa-17.3"></a>
<h2>[17.3] How can I handle a destructor that fails?</h2>

<p>
<b class="FAQ"><a href="http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/exceptions.html#faq-17.3">FAQ:</a></b>
 Actually you can&#39;t - not beyond logging the problem to a file or the like. In particular, <i>do not</i> throw an exception.
The problem is that destructors are called when exceptions are thrown so that functions propagating errors to their
callers can clean up resources. Your destructor can also be called in such a situation. And when an exception is already
thrown, throwing another one will result in a call to <tt>terminate()</tt>, killing your process. Because you see, what else could C++ do?
There&#39;s an ambiguity: which exception out of the two do you want caught now?
</p>

<p>
Strictly speaking, you can make that &quot;do not throw exceptions in a destructor unless you are sure that it won&#39;t be called
as a result of an exception already thrown&quot;, but you can rarely be sure of that.
</p>

<p>
<b class="FQA">FQA:</b> That&#39;s right, <tt>terminate()</tt>. Solomon-style conflict resolution carried to the end.
See? Exceptions are not a graceful way to handle errors.
</p>

<p>
And &quot;don&#39;t throw exceptions in destructors&quot; actually means &quot;don&#39;t call functions in destructors unless you
are sure they don&#39;t throw an exception&quot;. The C++ compiler won&#39;t check for you, because it can&#39;t: the language
doesn&#39;t force a function to declare whether it throws exceptions.
</p>

<p>
This is one good reason to avoid destructors
doing more than nothing: like constructors and operators, they can&#39;t handle errors.
</p>


<a name="fqa-17.4"></a>
<h2>[17.4] How should I handle resources if my constructors may throw exceptions?</h2>

<p>
<b class="FAQ"><a href="http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/exceptions.html#faq-17.4">FAQ:</a></b>
 Well, the destructor of your class will not get called, but the destructors of the successfully constructed
sub-objects will get called. Conclusion: you should have all the resources allocated by your constructors
assigned to sub-objects. For example, if you call <tt>new</tt> in a constructor, don&#39;t use a bare member pointer to hold
the result - use a smart pointer, like <tt>std::auto_ptr</tt>. You can also define your own smart pointer classes to
point to things like <a href="operator.html#fqa-13.3">disk records</a>! Groovy!
</p>

<p>
And you can use <tt>typedef</tt> to make the syntax of using smart pointers easier.
</p>

<p>
<b class="FQA">FQA:</b> <b>WARNING</b> - cyclic dependency between C++ features detected! You see, exceptions are a must in this language
so that you can handle errors in all the functions which fail to look like functions, such as constructors &amp; operators.
Then it turns out that you need <i>constructors</i> to work with <i>exceptions</i> - unless each and every piece of memory
you acquire is not immediately assigned to some smart pointer, your code is not exception safe. This is known
as &quot;Resource Allocation Is Initialization&quot; (RAII) in the C++ community; it&#39;s supposed to be a <i>good</i> thing.
</p>

<p>
And smart pointers are no picnic, as are virtually all automatic devices with something like &quot;smart&quot;, &quot;simple&quot; or
&quot;fast&quot; in their name. Sure, you can use <tt>typedef</tt> to simplify the syntax. So can someone else; you&#39;ll end up with
many different type names for the same thing. This may annoy people, but it&#39;s perfectly OK with the compiler -
when it spits an <a href="templates.html#fqa-35.17">error message</a>, it simply substitutes the full type names for all <tt>typedef</tt> names. But you can write a program to filter
the error messages...
</p>

<p>
Seriously, the syntax of smart pointers is the small problem. The big problem is their semantics. When you see
a bare pointer, you know how it works. But a smart pointer can work in <i>a lot</i> of ways. The <a href="http://boost.org">boost</a> libraries allow
you to instantiate hundreds of different smart pointer classes from a single template (which made it to TR1, so we&#39;re going to see it in the next version of the C++ standard). How are you going to
figure out whether your program manages resources correctly or not when it&#39;s littered with smart pointers of different kinds,
especially in case there&#39;s any non-trivial scenario there, like the cases when &quot;ownership&quot; (the right &amp; duty to dispose a resource)
is passed from object to object, or there are cyclic references in your code, or whatever?
</p>

<p>
When every single piece of software is &quot;smart&quot;, and you can&#39;t trust things like <tt>*p</tt> and <tt>p-&gt;x</tt>, the software
becomes unmanageable.

<h2>[17.5] How do I change the string-length of an array of <tt>char</tt> to prevent memory leaks even if/when someone throws an exception?</h2>

<p>
<b class="FAQ"><a href="http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/exceptions.html#faq-17.5">FAQ:</a></b>
 If you want to work with strings, use something like <tt>std::string</tt> instead of <tt>char*</tt>. Otherwise, there&#39;s lots
of exceptions to catch, and lots of code to manage memory.
</p>

<p>
<b class="FQA">FQA:</b> The FAQ is right about one thing - <tt>char*</tt> is a nasty kind of string, and using it for text processing is very
tedious. If you&#39;re doing anything not entirely trivial with strings, <tt>std::string</tt> is better than <tt>char*</tt>; using
a different language than C++ for text processing, one with a good built-in string type, is still better.
</p>

<p>
However, the part with exceptions really comes from <tt>operator new</tt>, not from <tt>char*</tt>. You can use <tt>malloc</tt> instead, or
configure your compiler to disable exceptions.
</p>


<a name="fqa-17.6"></a>
<h2>[17.6] What should I throw?</h2>

<p>
<b class="FAQ"><a href="http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/exceptions.html#faq-17.6">FAQ:</a></b>
 C++ allows you to throw objects of arbitrary types; however, you probably shouldn&#39;t throw objects of built-in
types. For example, you can derive all your exception classes from <tt>std::exception</tt>, and throw temporary objects
of your classes.
</p>

<p>
<b class="FQA">FQA:</b> Yep, C++ allows to throw anything. Too bad you can&#39;t really <i>catch</i> it later. The only way to catch an arbitrary exception
is to use <tt>catch(...)</tt>, which doesn&#39;t let you find out what was thrown from where, and will even catch
<i>illegal memory access</i> on some systems. This makes finding code like <tt>throw &quot;C++ is so grand - you can throw anything!!&quot;;</tt>
a lot of fun (you have to find it on occasions when the uncaught exception crashes your program).
</p>

<p>
The FAQ&#39;s advice is thus a good one, as opposed to the language decision to allow to throw anything - a typical example
of the twisted notion of &quot;generality&quot; used throughout the language design. This decision is completely incomprehensible
unless you realize that there&#39;s a basic axiom in C++: the language must not force the compiler writer to treat any class
specially. For example, having a common base class for all user-defined classes which have at least one <tt>virtual</tt> function could
be quite handy, but it&#39;s incompatible with this implicit axiom. What did the C++ designers gain from following this
bizarre rule? Apparently nothing, except for an illusion of &quot;generality&quot;, whatever that means.
</p>


<a name="fqa-17.7"></a>
<h2>[17.7] What does <tt>throw;</tt> (without an exception object after the <tt>throw</tt> keyword) mean? Where would I use it?</h2>

<p>
<b class="FAQ"><a href="http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/exceptions.html#faq-17.7">FAQ:</a></b>
 It means &quot;throw the last caught exception&quot;. It may be handy to catch an exception object, add some context information
and rethrow it; this way you get something like a stack trace. This feature also allows you to factor out several exception
handlers into a function called from a <tt>catch(...)</tt> block. Inside the function, you list the handlers for various special
cases and prefix them with <tt>try { throw; }</tt>.
</p>

<p>
<b class="FQA">FQA:</b> Rethrowing the last exception is a useful feature, and many languages have it. It would be equally useful in C++ if C++
exceptions were any good. In particular, having to use this kind of feature throughout the code to get a <i>call stack</i>
is an insult to the language user. Unless it&#39;s some kind of &quot;logical&quot; call stack (context information not equivalent to
the list of C++ functions you&#39;d see in a debugger at the point where the exception was thrown), call stacks should be
provided by the language.
</p>

<p>
If you are using C++ and want to figure out the current call stack, it may be better to
rely on platform-specific tricks (reading the frame pointer using inline assembly and traversing the linked list pointed
by it, then translating the instruction pointers using a symbol table) than to litter your code with statements
duplicating the information that&#39;s already there.
</p>


<a name="fqa-17.8"></a>
<h2>[17.8] How do I throw polymorphically?</h2>

<p>
<b class="FAQ"><a href="http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/exceptions.html#faq-17.8">FAQ:</a></b>
 Suppose you have a <tt>BaseEx</tt> exception class and a <tt>DerivedEx</tt> exception class, which is inherited from <tt>BaseEx</tt>.
Than the following code might not work as you expect:
</p>

<pre>
void f(BaseEx&amp; e)
{
  throw e;
}
void g()
{
  DerivedEx e;
  try {
    f(e);
  }
  catch(DerivedEx&amp;) {
    std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;derived exception caught&quot; &lt;&lt; std::endl;
  }
}
</pre>

<p>
The program will <i>not</i> enter the <tt>catch</tt> block because you didn&#39;t throw polymorphically. That is, the statement <tt>throw e;</tt>
throws the object <tt>e</tt> as a <tt>BaseEx</tt>, because that&#39;s the type of <tt>e</tt> in that context; once an object is thrown as a
<tt>BaseEx</tt>, it will not get caught as a <tt>DerivedEx</tt>. If you prefer the other behavior, you can &quot;easily get it&quot; by having a
<tt>virtual void raise() { throw *this; }</tt> in your base class <i>and</i> your derived class, and calling <tt>e.raise();</tt> instead of
<tt>throw e;</tt>. This way <tt>DerivedEx::raise()</tt> is called, and in the context of that function <tt>e</tt> is of type <tt>DerivedEx</tt>.
</p>

<p>
<b class="FQA">FQA:</b> Let&#39;s see. You use C++ exceptions. Moreover, you have a hierarchy of exception classes. Moreover, you <i>pass exception
objects to functions</i>, in a way relying on an <i>implicit upcast</i>. Looks like you have lots of confidence in your knowledge of
C++ features. But along comes C++ and beats your common sense once again. The startling inconsistency of the language is
almost a virtue: maybe this time you will learn the value of simplicity and write something readable.
</p>

<p>
The behavior of <tt>throw</tt>, which looks at the static type of its argument expression, is somewhat surprising considering the
behavior of <tt>catch</tt>, which does &quot;respect&quot; inheritance (to the extent made possible by <tt>throw</tt>). In practice, it is probably
better to remove some of the complexity in the example rather than add more complexity by mixing the dynamic binding
of <tt>virtual</tt> with the static binding of <tt>throw</tt>. A human might need to understand the code, you know.
</p>

<p>
If you do want
to memorize the quirks of C++, try to warp your mind to think in terms used by the compiler construction peanut gallery.
From this perspective, the behavior of <tt>throw</tt> and <tt>catch</tt> <i>is</i> consistent: both only look at things known at compile time
(the relationships between classes), and ignore things only known at run time (the actual type of an object). Basically
all of C++ behaves this way except for <tt>virtual</tt>, <tt>dynamic_cast</tt> and <tt>typeid</tt>. I think.
</p>


<a name="fqa-17.9"></a>
<h2>[17.9] When I throw this object, how many times will it be copied?</h2>

<p>
<b class="FAQ"><a href="http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/exceptions.html#faq-17.9">FAQ:</a></b>
 Zero or more. There&#39;s no universal answer. The compiler has to make sure a thrown object provides a copy constructor,
even if it doesn&#39;t actually copy anything.
</p>

<p>
<b class="FQA">FQA:</b> If you care about performance, C++ exceptions are probably no good for you. Exception support translates to a huge
mountain of code in your executable, and slows down function calls throughout your program. If you didn&#39;t care about
performance, you wouldn&#39;t ask this question. If you <i>think</i> that you <a href="ctors.html#fqa-10.9">care</a> about performance, but never actually measure
it or look at the performance implications of the techniques you use in your code, feel free to entertain yourself with
any fake answer that suits your emotional needs.

<h2>[17.10] Exception handling seems to make my life more difficult; clearly <i>I&#39;m</i> not the problem, am I??</h2>

<p>
<b class="FAQ"><a href="http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/exceptions.html#faq-17.10">FAQ:</a></b>
 <i>Of course</i> you can be the problem!
</p>

<p>
Here are some habits that may prevent you from utilizing the power of C++ exception handling:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <i>Return codes style</i>: people may put try blocks around every function call as if exceptions were error codes. </li>
<li> <i>The Java style</i>: using try/finally instead of RAII, cluttering the code with clean-up statements. </li>
<li> <i>Organizing exceptions around the location of the error rather than its reason</i>: this way you need to handle
the same error many times and convert between types of exceptions. </li>
<li> <i>Categorizing errors using data members of exception classes rather than types</i>: this way you catch more errors
than you can handle in the given <tt>catch</tt> blocks, and rethrow exceptions after a test. </li>
<li> <i>Using different exception classes in different subsystems</i>: the FAQ decides to repeat the point before
previous, probably to create an impression that there are so many wrong mindsets out there. </li>
<li> <i>Using bare pointers instead of smart pointer classes</i>: a special case of avoiding RAII, admits the FAQ, but
it can&#39;t fight the temptation to list yet another &quot;wrong mindset&quot;. </li>
<li> <i>Confusing bugs with run time errors</i>: if someone passes a null pointer to a function when that&#39;s illegal,
the code must be fixed. Throwing an exception without fixing the calling code doesn&#39;t solve the problem. </li>
</ul>

<p>
There are other wrong mindsets as well.
</p>

<p>
<b class="FQA">FQA:</b> Yeah, you know how it is with those humans. They always <a href="assign.html#fqa-12.2">fail to realize</a> <i>they</i> are the problem, and keep asking the
wrong questions. You give them a helpful and powerful language, and all they do is shooting themselves in the feet. Clearly
it&#39;s their flawed minds that must be fixed.
</p>

<p>
Let&#39;s look a little closer at the impressive list of &quot;wrong mindsets&quot; compiled by the FAQ:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <i>Return codes style</i> is surely a wrong way to use exceptions, but it&#39;s one of the best ways to use <i>C++ exceptions</i>,
because otherwise the chance to manage resources correctly is not very high. Of course using real return codes is somewhat
cleaner, but what if exceptions are thrown by third-party libraries? </li>
<li> <i>The Java style</i> is suited quite well to a managed environment like Java, because most of the so-called resources
are in fact <i>memory</i>, and you only need try/finally blocks for stuff like files, of which there are few. This style
is problematic in C++ which <a href="heap.html#fqa-16.1">lacks garbage collection</a>, but so is <a href="exceptions.html#fqa-17.4">RAII</a> which forces you to wrap everything with
&quot;smart pointers&quot; in a language which
only has built-in dumb pointers. The truth is that with C++ exceptions, you can&#39;t win. </li>
<li> <i>Organizing exceptions around the location of the error rather than its reason</i>: suppose you have 2 parsers in
your system. Would you prefer a single <tt>ParseError</tt> exception, or 2 separate classes, <tt>HtmlParseError</tt> and
<tt>ConfigFileParseError</tt>? Two different modules may raise exceptions for <i>similar</i> reasons, but rarely <i>the same</i> reason -
or else why are they different modules? An obvious exception to this rule are errors detected at the language level,
things like <tt>ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException</tt>. Luckily, the C++ language run time environment does not detect errors,
so we don&#39;t need to discuss this kind of thing. </li>
<li> <i>Categorizing errors using data members of exception classes rather than types</i> is not necessarily bad. C++ is
centered around the <a href="io.html#fqa-15.1">assumption</a> that you can represent almost anything using types (class hierarchies or template &quot;pattern matching&quot;)
more than any other popular statically typed language. However, this assumption is frequently refuted by reality,
and sticking to it is counter-productive in many cases. For instance, if a subsystem throws exceptions of a single class,
and you figure out the kind of error from looking at the object members or even inspecting error strings, you may end
up with less problems compared to the case where you have several dozens of classes in your exception inheritance tree.
This is a special case where modeling an aspect of your program using the language static type system may or may not be
optimal. </li>
<li> <i>Using different exception classes in different subsystems</i>: WOW, this is so <i>nasty</i>! Of course all subsystems
should share exception classes and other important common types. All subsystems of all systems in the world should be written
in close coordination between the implementers. This way, we&#39;ll finish the Tower of Babel in no time! That&#39;s why a
language should have no good way to pass an object of arbitrary type through a &quot;subsystem&quot;.
Trust us: we are the people advocating a language without a <i>common string type</i>.
We sure know a thing or two about the issue.
<li> <i>Using bare pointers instead of smart pointer classes</i>: how about starting with the language and the standard
library? When <tt>operator new</tt> returns a smart pointer, and <tt>&quot;abc&quot;</tt> has the type <tt>std::string</tt>, we&#39;ll have something
to discuss. Until then, why should anyone manually emulate a high-level language on top of a low-level one throughout
one&#39;s code? </li>
<li> <i>Confusing bugs with run time errors</i>: this has absolutely nothing to do with exceptions. It&#39;s equally applicable
to any run time error handling strategy. Unless, of course, your environment throws exceptions upon events like null pointer dereferencing,

<h2>[17.11] I have too many try blocks; what can I do about it?</h2>

<p>
<b class="FAQ"><a href="http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/exceptions.html#faq-17.11">FAQ:</a></b>
 Maybe you have a &quot;return codes mindset&quot; even though syntactically you use exceptions. There are many special cases
of this problem in which you can organize the code differently to reduce the amount of try blocks (the FAQ lists several cases).
If you can&#39;t solve the problem yourself, get a mentor.
