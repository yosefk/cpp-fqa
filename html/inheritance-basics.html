<h2>[19.1] Is inheritance important to C++?</h2>

<p>
<b class="FAQ"><a href="http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/basics-of-inheritance.html#faq-19.1">FAQ:</a></b>
 Sure. That&#39;s the new thing OO adds on top of the more basic notion of abstract data types.
</p>

<p>
<b class="FQA">FQA:</b> It is, but for a slightly different reason. C++ uses inheritance to implement run-time polymorphism -
allow to use two objects of different classes in the same way. In order for this to work, the classes
(very roughly) must be inherited from a common base class.
</p>

<p>
It is also possible to implement polymorphism without inheritance. The system may simply allow you to
call the methods of an object without knowing its type, and the code will work if and only if the
object actually has the methods with the right name and arguments. Such systems may still support
inheritance, but it&#39;s less central for them.
</p>

<p>
OO systems encouraging polymorphism of the former kind are said to be &quot;statically typed&quot; in the sense
that you use objects through explicitly defined interfaces which are visible at compile time. This
approach is well-established and has many pros and cons (so does the other approach).
The C++ choice to use this approach is &quot;legitimate&quot; in the sense that it can yield a relatively usable &amp; consistent result.
</p>

<p>
However, C++ inheritance is designed to support many other things, leading to a less usable and less
consistent result. In particular, inheritance complicates the already complicated name look-up
in many ways unique to C++, and <a href="inheritance-multiple.html#fqa-25.2">multiple inheritance</a> is quite a mess. On the other hand, many handy
features are left out, for example, there are no multimethods or dynamic type information allowing
to list the interfaces supported by a class (the latter is a special case of lacking reflection).
</p>

<h2>[19.2] When would I use inheritance?</h2>

<p>
<b class="FAQ"><a href="http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/basics-of-inheritance.html#faq-19.2">FAQ:</a></b>
 As a tool for specifying the behavior of a system. People think in two dimensions: &quot;is a&quot;
and &quot;has a&quot;. For instance, a cat &quot;is a&quot; mammal and &quot;has a&quot; tail. Aggregation of data into
abstract data types supports the &quot;has a&quot; dimension. Inheritance adds support for the &quot;is a&quot; dimension.
</p>

<p>
<b class="FQA">FQA:</b> <i>When appropriate</i>. The FAQ itself does <a href="inheritance-proper.html#fqa-21.8">a pretty good
job</a> listing situations when something &quot;is a&quot; something else on an intuitive level, but using inheritance
is still wrong. Inheritance is a formal concept, and formal concepts don&#39;t map directly to English words.
</p>

<p>
Nobody knows the number of dimensions people use to think yet. For example, imagine a black cat. Does it
&quot;have a&quot; black color or &quot;is a&quot; black object? What if it&#39;s under a table - does it &quot;have a&quot; table above it
or &quot;is a&quot; thing under a table? Nobody knows what &quot;thinking&quot; is, and natural language can not be reduced
to a couple of dimensions. It &quot;has&quot; an unknown number of dimensions. It &quot;is a&quot; thing with an unknown number
of dimensions. Whatever &quot;dimension&quot; means.
</p>

<p>
A programming language is a tool people use to <i>program</i> machines. Even if we knew how thinking works, and
we could build a &quot;thinking machine&quot;, we&#39;d still need programming languages for <i>the other</i> machines. The
ones that are supposed to do what they are told, quickly, reliably and cheaply, as opposed to those
supposed to be creative thinkers. And a programming language, which must be precise, can not map directly
to a natural language, which is not.
</p>

<p>
To use inheritance or any other formal device, you have to understand exactly how it works. Luckily,
in most programming languages it&#39;s reasonably easy. And with C++, you can at least try to restrict
yourself to the subset you do understand.
</p>


<a name="fqa-19.3"></a>
<h2>[19.3] How do you express inheritance in C++?</h2>

<p>
<b class="FAQ"><a href="http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/basics-of-inheritance.html#faq-19.3">FAQ:</a></b>
 By using the <tt>: public</tt> syntax, as in <tt>class Car : public Vehicle { ... };</tt>. <tt>private</tt> and <tt>protected</tt>
inheritance are different.
</p>

<p>
<b class="FQA">FQA:</b> Yeah, very different: replace the <tt>public</tt> keyword with the <tt>private</tt> or <tt>protected</tt> keyword.
The FAQ probably means that they are different because they are less related to OO semantically.
</p>

<p>
You may wonder what the colon syntax has to do with the concept of inheritance. Well, the
connection is obvious: there&#39;s no inheritance in C, and adding keywords to C++ reduces the
<a href="picture.html#fqa-6.11">"compatibility"</a> with C, because the grammars of these languages prevent you from using keywords
as identifiers. Once again, punctuation comes to the rescue.
The other technique for retro-fitting features into the grammar is overloading keywords
(consider <tt>static</tt>).
</p>

<p>
To be fair, many languages have this problem with their grammar, and it&#39;s not a very big deal.
</p>


<a name="fqa-19.4"></a>
<h2>[19.4] Is it OK to convert a pointer from a derived class to its base class?</h2>

<p>
<b class="FAQ"><a href="http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/basics-of-inheritance.html#faq-19.4">FAQ:</a></b>
 For public inheritance - yes. By definition, an object of a derived class is an object of the base class.
</p>

<p>
<b class="FQA">FQA:</b> Moreover, if you don&#39;t think someone is going to do this, or you know it&#39;s not going to work
as expected, <a href="inheritance-proper.html#fqa-21.6">don't use inheritance</a>. The whole point of inheritance is to allow exactly that:
to have code that works with objects of a base class and in fact can be passed objects of
arbitrary derived classes. If making this possible is not what you want, inheritance doesn&#39;t
really help you and will confuse the users of your classes.
</p>

<p>
Of course public inheritance is also used for mind numbing template metaprogramming tricks, like having
a template derive from its own instantiation recursively, or from a template argument. The judgment
of whether this is a reasonable usage of a language feature is left to the reader.
</p>


<a name="fqa-19.5"></a>
<h2>[19.5] What&#39;s the difference between <tt>public</tt>, <tt>private</tt>, and <tt>protected</tt>?</h2>

<p>
<b class="FAQ"><a href="http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/basics-of-inheritance.html#faq-19.5">FAQ:</a></b>
 <tt>private</tt> is for class members and friends. <tt>protected</tt> is also for derived classes and their friends. <tt>public</tt> is
for everybody.
</p>

<p>
<b class="FQA">FQA:</b> Exactly. The only part having to do with inheritance is <tt>protected</tt>, and it&#39;s useful relatively rarely.
</p>


<a name="fqa-19.6"></a>
<h2>[19.6] Why can&#39;t my derived class access <tt>private</tt> things from my base class?</h2>

<p>
<b class="FAQ"><a href="http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/basics-of-inheritance.html#faq-19.6">FAQ:</a></b>
 It protects you from changes to the base class by not letting you rely on its implementation details.
</p>

<p>
<b class="FQA">FQA:</b> However, it doesn&#39;t protect you from recompilation of your derived classes when changes are made to
the base class (access control keywords are <a href="class.html#fqa-7.4">little more than comments</a> in C++). Keep that in mind when
you design interfaces, especially those which are supposed to be used outside of your team. If you want
to supply C++ interfaces, which is <a href="picture.html#fqa-6.3">pretty daring</a> by itself, not exposing any base classes except pure
abstract ones (those having no data members) may be a good idea.
</p>


<a name="fqa-19.7"></a>
<h2>[19.7] How can I protect derived classes from breaking when I change the internal parts of the base class?</h2>

<p>
<b class="FAQ"><a href="http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/basics-of-inheritance.html#faq-19.7">FAQ:</a></b>
 Your class has two interfaces: <tt>public</tt> and <tt>protected</tt>. To protect your users, don&#39;t expose
data members. Similarly, you can protect the derived classes by not having <tt>protected</tt> data members;
provide <tt>protected inline</tt> accessors instead.
</p>

<p>
<b class="FQA">FQA:</b> Dear Design Guru! Listen carefully, and try to understand.
</p>

<p>
One. Writing get and set function for every member takes
time, and so does reading them. This time can instead be used to get something done.
</p>

<p>
Two. If you can get and set a member, it&#39;s pretty close to being public.
Any non-trivial representation change becomes impossible since the ability to set this particular member
is now a part of the contract.
</p>

<p>
Three. Having properties in the language - things that look like members
but are in fact accessors - doesn&#39;t hurt. Many languages have it, allowing to use plain members and
in the 0.1% of the cases when your class becomes very popular <i>and</i> you want to change it <i>and</i> you
can do it without breaking the contract, you can make the member a property. There&#39;s no reason for not
having this in C++ that&#39;s even remotely interesting to a language user.
</p>

<p>
If you know C++ programmers who are obsessed with useless wrapper code <i>and</i> performance they never measure,
the <tt>protected inline</tt> part is kinda funny.
</p>


<a name="fqa-19.8"></a>
<h2>[19.8] I&#39;ve been told to never use protected data, and instead to always use private data with protected access functions. Is that a good rule?</h2>

<p>
<b class="FAQ"><a href="http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/basics-of-inheritance.html#faq-19.8">FAQ:</a></b>
 No, no, no - &quot;always&quot; rules don&#39;t work in the real world! You don&#39;t have time to make life
easy for everyone. Spend your time making it easy for the important people. People are not equal.
The important people are called &quot;customers&quot;.
</p>

<p>
<b class="FQA">FQA:</b> Thanks, that&#39;s just what I needed! You know, I was going to make life easier for <i>everyone</i>
by writing hordes of get and set functions. But now I can <i>prioritize</i> and only make life easier
for the important people.
</p>

<p>
Please your customers by writing 56% more get and set functions than your competitor using the newest
Visual Refactoring Tool today!
</p>

<p>
Actually, the FAQ does mention that you&#39;ll probably need more than get and set functions to really
&quot;protect the derived classes from changes&quot;. But the basic assumption that lots of layers
make life easy when you have time to create all those layers is still ridiculous. There are teams
out there that actually <i>have</i> lots of time to do a real world job, and turn a 500-line simple, working, fast
prototype program into 30K-line incomprehensible, broken, slow &quot;product&quot; because they think that
they are dealing with an <i>important</i> task, so now is the time to write piles of wrapper code.
</p>


<a name="fqa-19.9"></a>
<h2>[19.9] Okay, so exactly how should I decide whether to build a &quot;protected interface&quot;?</h2>

<p>
<b class="FAQ"><a href="http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/basics-of-inheritance.html#faq-19.9">FAQ:</a></b>
 There are many useful guidelines, for example: grow up, don&#39;t do things that can jeopardize your
schedules, and only invest time in the things which will ultimately pay off.
</p>

<p>
<b class="FQA">FQA:</b> If you find this advice useful, here&#39;s more: don&#39;t be an idiot, be lucky, and avoid pushing sharp
objects into your body.
</p>

<p>
It&#39;s rather annoying that the C++ FAQ <i>dares</i> to tell people to be <a href="picture.html#fqa-6.1">"practical"</a>. Why don&#39;t you add a third
useful built-in type to your language (we already have integers and floats), say, a string or
a dictionary, and then talk about the difference between theory and the real world?
