<h1>Change log</h1>
<small class="part">Part of <a href="index.html">C++ FQA Lite</a></small><hr>
  
<p>
This is a list of changes in the FQA part of the site done after October 28, 2007. It only mentions &quot;real&quot; changes to the contents,
not typo fixes and such.
</p>

<p>
The Q&amp;A sections of the FQA and Defective C++ are probably not going to change much; mostly, I plan to add links
to corrections on a separate page.
</p>

<p>
<i>2009-10-17</i>
</p>

<p>
Added a correction about conversions between code and data pointers,
and a reader&#39;s submission regarding a truly mind-numbing error message.
</p>

<p>
<i>2008-06-28</i>
</p>

<p>
Added a single page version (Defective C++, Q&amp;A, FQA errors, everything else
left out). Linked to it from the index page. Deleted a sentence from the FQA
errors page, added a sentence to the FQA FAQ. That kind of stuff.
</p>

<p>
<i>2008-05-08</i>
</p>

<p>
Added two C++ corrections (regarding <tt>#define private public</tt> and
multi-dimensional arrays). Slight editing of the FAQ (most notably,
added a correction about the flat Earth issue). All pages should now
be <a href="http://tidy.sourceforge.net/">tidy</a>.
</p>

<p>
The outburst of activity is the result of finally taking control over
my hateful world-class FQA publishing software, which was, at last, merged,
fixed,
and put on a single machine. From now on, fixes should appear instantaneously
(as opposed to being deferred until I take control over my hateful publishing
software).
</p>

<p>
<i>2008-01-02</i>
</p>

<p>
Added the Cat++ link face, at the end of a day of C++ debugging.
I wonder if it shows in the so-called art.
</p>

<p>
<i>2007-11-03</i>
</p>

<p>
Added an FQA correction - C++ has <tt>bool</tt>.
</p>

<p>
Linked to the <tt>comp.lang.c++.moderated</tt> thread from the FQA FAQ.
</p>

<p>
Added an image with <tt>operator&lt;&lt;</tt> to the link faces page.
</p>

<p>
<i>2007-10-31</i>
</p>

<p>
Added an item about iostream and internationalization to others&#39; criticism page.
</p>

<p>
Renamed the &quot;Web vs *&quot; pages since the names started to look annoying to me.
What was I thinking?
</p>

<p>
Edited in a correction about EDG selling Java and Fortran front-ends,
and then removed the whole thing.
</p>

<p>
<i>2007-10-30</i>
</p>

<p>
Added the Web vs C++ page and the first three issues (implicit conversions and parsing C++ x 2).
</p>

<p>
Updated the FQA FAQ to mention the corrections page in the present tense, since it now exists,
and added three braindead, but genuinely frequently asked questions.
</p>

<p>
<i>2007-10-29</i>
</p>

<p>
Added the Web vs C++ FQA page and the first correction (virtual inheritance).
</p>

<p>
Gave up on Web 2.0 and asked people to e-mail me if they want to talk about the FQA.
Updated the FAQ and the main page.
</p>
