<h2>[15.1] Why should I use <tt>&lt;iostream&gt;</tt> instead of the traditional <tt>&lt;cstdio&gt;</tt>?</h2>

<p>
<b class="FAQ"><a href="http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/input-output.html#faq-15.1">FAQ:</a></b>
 There are four reasons:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <i>Increase type safety</i>: with <tt>iostream</tt>, the compiler knows the types of the things you print. <tt>stdio</tt> only figures them out at
run time from the format string. </li>
<li> <i>Reduce the number of errors</i>: with <tt>stdio</tt>, the types of objects you pass must be consistent with the format string;
<tt>iostream</tt> removes this redundancy - there is no format string, so you can&#39;t make these errors. </li>
<li> <i>Printing objects of user-defined types</i>: with <tt>iostream</tt>, you can overload the operators <tt>&lt;&lt;</tt> and <tt>&gt;&gt;</tt> to support
new types, and the old code won&#39;t break. <tt>stdio</tt> won&#39;t let you extend the format string syntax, and there seems to be no way
to support this kind of thing in a way avoiding conflicts between different extensions. </li>
<li> <i>Printing to streams of user-defined types</i>: you can implement your own stream classes by deriving from the
base classes provided by <tt>iostream</tt>. <tt>FILE*</tt> can not be extended because &quot;it&#39;s not a real class&quot;. </li>
</ul>

<p>
<b class="FQA">FQA:</b> Why should I do this, why should I do that, you ask. What kind of manners are these? Do what you are told. Assignment Number 1 - convert all your evil
<tt>printf(&quot;0x%08xn&quot;, x)</tt> statements to this:
</p>

<pre>
std::cout &lt;&lt; std::hex &lt;&lt; std::setfill(&#39;0&#39;) &lt;&lt; std::setw(8) &lt;&lt; x &lt;&lt; std::dec &lt;&lt; std::endl; 
</pre>

<p>
Even if you commit the environmental crime of namespace pollution, adding a <tt>using namespace std</tt>
and removing those pesky <tt>std::</tt>, the verbosity is still amazing. This achievement is not accidental.
It follows from one of the basic flaws in the C++ way of thinking:
the &quot;everything is a type&quot; axiom. For example, <tt>hex</tt> has a special type which hexes streams, and so does every
other strange object sent to <tt>cout</tt>.
</p>

<p>
The FAQ explains why this thinking is good for you. Here&#39;s why the FAQ is wrong:
</p>

<ul>
<li> Why is <i>type safety</i> a good thing here - because we gain performance? The last time I checked, we didn&#39;t really gain
any - your typical iostream implementation is slower and bulkier than your typical stdio implementation. Anyway, isn&#39;t I/O
the bottleneck here? </li>
<li> Oh, now I get it - type safety is supposed to help the compiler <i>catch errors</i>. This is very important for people
who never actually look at what they print. The needs of this population surely justify the 700K of crud that <tt>gcc</tt> gets
to parse when compiling a C++ &quot;Hello, world&quot; problem, as well as my time spent waiting for it to compile. What&#39;s easier
to fix: a run-time printf problem or a compile-time iostream problem (with the compiler helpfully listing hundreds of <a href="operator.html#fqa-13.1">overloaded</a> left shift operators)? </li>
<li> Maybe &quot;everything is a type&quot; is a good thing because it lets you <i>print objects of user-defined types</i>. If you
believe this, concentrate for 10 seconds - this is your chance to achieve enlightenment. <b> What on Earth prevents
you from printing user-defined objects with printf? </b> You write a helper function which gets a pointer to your
object and prints it. While you&#39;re at it, give the function some special name, so that you don&#39;t have to shovel through lists of overloads
anymore. What&#39;s that? It&#39;s verbose, because function calls are separate statements, unlike the funky left shift operators?
Well, look at a simple statement printing an integer above if you care about verbosity. </li>
<li> What about <i>printing to streams of user-defined types</i>? Well, this claim is valid in the sense that there&#39;s no way to define custom
<tt>FILE*</tt>, but it has nothing to do with the fact that &quot;it&#39;s not a real class&quot;. A &quot;real class&quot; is not a very well-defined
term; to me, C++ classes look <a href="class.html#fqa-7.1">pretty surreal</a> compared to classes defined in almost any other language I&#39;ve ever seen. Anyway,
stdio could provide ways to define custom <tt>FILE*</tt>, for instance by providing <tt>read</tt>, <tt>write</tt> and other callbacks.
The authors just didn&#39;t bother. The ability to define custom streams does not justify the problems
of iostream, nor is it a feature unique to iostream. This ability is achieved in (relatively) sane OO ways, (almost) in the way it&#39;s done
in many languages saner than C++ and I/O libraries saner than iostream. </li>
</ul>

<p>
<tt>iostream</tt>. The only thing you&#39;ll gain from all this extra typing is extra long build cycles and error messages and extra large
program image. This is what you get when you shift a file object by an integer.

<h2>[15.2] Why does my program go into an infinite loop when someone enters an invalid input character?</h2>

<p>
<b class="FAQ"><a href="http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/input-output.html#faq-15.2">FAQ:</a></b>
 Probably you did something like <tt>int i; std::cin &gt;&gt; i;</tt> without checking for an error.
From now on, all attempts to read stuff from <tt>std::cin</tt> won&#39;t actually read anything, because the stream has entered
an erroneous state. Presumably, you wrote a program that will still keep trying. Use something like <tt>while(std::cin &gt;&gt; i)</tt>
instead.
</p>

<p>
<b class="FQA">FQA:</b> Yep, that&#39;s iostream&#39;s way to handle input errors. For some reason, it doesn&#39;t throw an <a href="exceptions.html#fqa-17.1">exception</a> (it&#39;s not really
bad, because what&#39;s really bad is C++ exceptions). But it doesn&#39;t return an error code, either, because the overloaded operator
<a href="operator.html#fqa-13.1">has to return its first argument</a> for the &quot;neat&quot; operator call chaining to work. So it has to set an error bit - the
dreaded <a href="exceptions.html#fqa-17.2">"zombie object"</a> pattern the FAQ condemns so convincingly.
</p>

<p>
You can then check for errors using <tt>if(std::cin)</tt> or the like because the object has overloaded <tt>operator void*</tt>,
and <tt>void*</tt> is convertible to <tt>bool</tt>. You
can also check for end-of-file conditions this way. Actually you can check for error-or-end-of-file conditions. The more
operator calls you chain, the less details about the error context are left. Simple, safe, efficient and elegant.
</p>

<p>
Oh, and iostream has other state bits. For example, <tt>std::hex</tt> transfers it to hex mode. People frequently forget
to undo the effect, which is especially entertaining when they print numbers like <tt>10</tt>, which is as good a decimal
ten as it is a hexadecimal sixteen. Well, if you found the bug (which for some reason went undetected by the type-safe almighty paranoid C++ compiler),
you can use <tt>std::dec</tt> to get the stream back to decimal mode. Um, actually, it transfers it to decimal mode, which is not necessarily &quot;back&quot;, because
we don&#39;t know which mode it was in before it was hexed. This gets interesting when people print numbers and user-defined
objects in the same statement, and count on their hexing to maintain its effect after the user-defined object is printed.
</p>


<a name="fqa-15.3"></a>
<h2>[15.3] How can I get <tt>std::cin</tt> to skip invalid input characters?</h2>

<p>
<b class="FAQ"><a href="http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/input-output.html#faq-15.3">FAQ:</a></b>
 Here&#39;s an example:
</p>

<pre>
   while ((std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Give me your credit card number now!!&quot;) &amp;&amp; !(std::cin &gt;&gt; n)) {
     std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Don&#39;t mess with me, I&#39;m written in C++!!!&quot;;
     std::cin.clear();
     std::cin.ignore(std::numeric_limits&lt;std::streamsize&gt;::max(), &#39;\n&#39;);
   }
</pre>

<p>
<b class="FQA">FQA:</b> Oops, you forgot to test for end of file. If a brave user hits <tt>Ctrl-D</tt> or whatever it takes to close the standard input
with the given terminal, your program will enter an infinite loop. Overloaded operators and error handling are not
very compatible.
</p>

<p>
<tt>std::cin.ignore(std::numeric_limits&lt;std::streamsize&gt;::max(), &#39;\n&#39;);</tt> speaks for itself. You just can&#39;t invent it if
your &quot;use case&quot; is yourself getting any work done.
</p>


<a name="fqa-15.4"></a>
<h2>[15.4] How does that funky <tt>while (std::cin &gt;&gt; foo)</tt> syntax work?</h2>

<p>
<b class="FAQ"><a href="http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/input-output.html#faq-15.4">FAQ:</a></b>
 <tt>istream</tt> has overloaded <tt>operator void*</tt>. The compiler calls this operator in boolean contexts (when it expects a condition, for example),
because <tt>void*</tt> can be converted to a boolean. The operator returns <tt>NULL</tt> when there&#39;s nothing left to read, or
when a format error occurred previously.
</p>

<p>
<b class="FQA">FQA:</b> There&#39;s nothing &quot;funky&quot; about it.
It is ugly and boring. It&#39;s also scary because many people think this is what programming is all about - using complicated
syntax to do simple things without even getting them right (how do you tell end-of-file conditions from format errors?).
</p>

<p>
Why is it <tt>operator void*</tt>, and not <tt>operator bool</tt>? Apparently because the compiler implicitly converts booleans to numbers
in &quot;numeric contexts&quot; (such as <tt>file1+file2</tt>), and we don&#39;t want that to compile, do we?
</p>

<p>
But wait, there&#39;s more! There&#39;s an actual book out there, called &quot;Imperfect C++&quot;, arguing that <tt>operator void*</tt> is not
 the way to go, either. Because this way, <tt>delete file</tt> would compile. Surely we don&#39;t want it to, do we? I mean,
 the fact that the statement is completely <i>moronic</i> shouldn&#39;t matter. Morones have a right to get an equal opportunity
 in the exciting world of C++ programming; let&#39;s catch of all their errors at compile time. Evil people spread
 rumors about the problem being undecidable, but we should keep trying.
</p>


<a name="fqa-15.5"></a>
<h2>[15.5] Why does my input seem to process past the end of file?</h2>

<p>
<b class="FAQ"><a href="http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/input-output.html#faq-15.5">FAQ:</a></b>
 Because the stream doesn&#39;t know that you&#39;ve reached the end of file until you actually try to read past the end of file.
For instance, a stream object may read characters which are entered interactively using a keyboard. So it&#39;s impossible
to tell when it&#39;s over.
</p>

<p>
<b class="FQA">FQA:</b> That&#39;s right, and has nothing to do with iostream - except the fact that iostream handles I/O errors in the silly
way discussed <a href="io.html#fqa-15.4">above</a>.
</p>


<a name="fqa-15.6"></a>
<h2>[15.6] Why is my program ignoring my input request after the first iteration?</h2>

<p>
<b class="FAQ"><a href="http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/input-output.html#faq-15.6">FAQ:</a></b>
 Because non-digits are left in the input buffer. You can ignore them using calls like <tt>std::cin.ignore(std::numeric_limits&lt;std::streamsize&gt;::max(), &#39;\n&#39;);</tt>
</p>

<p>
<b class="FQA">FQA:</b> Doesn&#39;t the fact that there are <a href="io.html#fqa-15.2">so</a> <a href="io.html#fqa-15.3">many</a> questions about the handling of input format problems ring a bell?
This silent treatment of errors is wrong. Stuff like parsing is better handled by languages which have good support
for <a href="exceptions.html#fqa-17.1">exceptions</a> (<a href="picture.html#fqa-6.2">built-in strings and containers</a> help, too). If you have to live without exceptions, at least the library
should treat errors reasonably. The iostream interface of operator call chains makes error handling as awkward as it gets.
</p>


<a name="fqa-15.7"></a>
<h2>[15.7] Should I end my output lines with <tt>std::endl</tt> or <tt>&#39;\n&#39;</tt>?</h2>

<p>
<b class="FAQ"><a href="http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/input-output.html#faq-15.7">FAQ:</a></b>
 The former has the additional side-effect of flushing the output buffer. Therefore, the latter will probably work
faster.
</p>

<p>
<b class="FQA">FQA:</b> The latter is also shorter, unless you have a <tt>using namespace std</tt>. Many people probably ask this question because
they think that <tt>endl</tt> will end the line the way it&#39;s normally done at a given platform (say, emit CRLF on Windows and LF
on Unix). When <tt>endl</tt> behaves that way, so does <tt>&#39;\n&#39;</tt>. You can <a href="io.html#fqa-15.12">suppress this behavior</a> when you open the file
(pass <tt>ios::binary</tt> with iostream or the <tt>&quot;b&quot;</tt> flag with <tt>fopen</tt>).
</p>


<a name="fqa-15.8"></a>
<h2>[15.8] How can I provide printing for my <tt>class Fred</tt>?</h2>

<p>
<b class="FAQ"><a href="http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/input-output.html#faq-15.8">FAQ:</a></b>
 By adding a <tt>friend std::ostream&amp; operator&lt;&lt; (std::ostream&amp; o, const Fred&amp; fred);</tt>. The operator <a href="friend.html#fqa-14.2">can't be a member
of the class</a>, because we need the object to be the second argument, not the first one.
</p>

<p>
<b class="FQA">FQA:</b> Yeah, yeah, C++ and its stupid syntax. Let&#39;s forget about it for a moment: the real problem here is semantical, and it
starts at the question &quot;How can I provide printing <i>for my class</i>?&quot;. The formulation encourages to give an answer
in the spirit of <a href="io.html#fqa-15.1">"everything is a type"</a>, and indeed this is the kind of answer given by the FAQ. Here&#39;s <i>the</i> way
to print <i>all</i> objects of your class.
</p>

<p>
But was that really your question? What if you want more than a single output format for your class?
For instance, you might want a textual format for people and a binary format for machines. Or there could be
several textual formats - even integers can be printed using different bases. Do you really want to develop
and maintain the layers of syntax needed to make things like <tt>hex</tt> and <tt>dec</tt> sort of work? Why not just define
named functions for printing?
</p>

<p>
The <tt>friend</tt> thing is also questionable. With all due respect, you might want to print to several different
output channels, <i>without</i> creating an adapter class derived from <tt>ostream</tt>. One simple reason for such
heretical behavior is performance - <tt>ostream</tt> may be too slow for things like real-time logging. Why not create accessors to the data you want to print, so that all
the different output methods won&#39;t need to be part of your class, which may then have a stable interface? <a href="class.html#fqa-7.4">Encapsulation</a>? You&#39;ve already made
your data public - one can read it by printing to a <tt>stringstream</tt>. Providing accessors violates <a href="class.html#fqa-7.7">obfuscation</a>,
not encapsulation.
</p>

<p>
If you abandon the <tt>friend</tt> part and the <tt>operator</tt> part, the remaining part of the FAQ&#39;s answer - create
a global function accepting some kind of stream object and an object of your class and do the printing there -
makes a good advice. In particular, it may be better than a method for the same reasons making it better than
a friend (however, unlike a friend, a method may be polymorphic, which might be useful).
</p>


<a name="fqa-15.9"></a>
<h2>[15.9] But shouldn&#39;t I always use a <tt>printOn()</tt> method rather than a <tt>friend</tt> function?</h2>

<p>
<b class="FAQ"><a href="http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/input-output.html#faq-15.9">FAQ:</a></b>
 Not &quot;always&quot;. A method may be useful for a class hierarchy, for example, but in that case it would
normally be protected, not public.
</p>

<p>
Some people think <tt>friend</tt> violates encapsulation, and therefore
prefer to have their <tt>operator&lt;&lt;</tt> call a public method of the class, even though there&#39;s no class hierarchy. Their basic assumption is wrong,
so they end up writing extra code that doesn&#39;t solve any real problems and confuses people.
</p>

<p>
<b class="FQA">FQA:</b> Just to make things clear: a <tt>printOn()</tt> method is something like <tt>void Fred::printOn(std::ostream&amp; o) const</tt>.
</p>

<p>
The FAQ is right about the important thing: creating extra layers of code doing nothing but delegating
work to other layers of code is a pesky habit. Many people feel that &quot;good design&quot; means &quot;lots of code&quot;
or &quot;lots of layers&quot;. Actually, those are some of the meanings of &quot;bad design&quot;.
</p>

<p>
The fact that <tt>friend</tt> is really needed here to compensate for syntactical limitations of C++,
as well as the problems with the whole <tt>friend operator</tt> approach, are discussed in <a href="io.html#fqa-15.8">the previous FAQ</a>. They are not
the main theme here. The main theme here is the message to the &quot;designers&quot;: listen to the voice
of C++ overlords who originally inspired you to create N layers with 0 functionality, and stop.

<h2>[15.10] How can I provide input for my <tt>class Fred</tt>?</h2>

<p>
<b class="FAQ"><a href="http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/input-output.html#faq-15.10">FAQ:</a></b>
 By adding a <tt>friend std::istream&amp; operator&gt;&gt; (std::istream&amp; i, Fred&amp; fred);</tt>
</p>

<p>
<b class="FQA">FQA:</b> This defective technique is symmetrical to the <tt>operator&lt;&lt;</tt> thing, which was discussed above.
We&#39;ll use this opportunity to look at some advanced defects of this approach. For beginner&#39;s defects, go
<a href="io.html#fqa-15.8">two FAQs back</a>.
</p>

<p>
The complicated problems come from the same source as the simple problems: the idea that for each type,
we want exactly one output function looking like a bit shift operator. Therefore, to create complicated problems,
we&#39;ll need some complicated types. Luckily, C++ comes with one of the most complicated type systems in the solar system
(itself an example of a simpler system).
</p>

<p>
Consider <tt>std::map</tt>. It&#39;s standard, and so is iostream. Does this mean that the operators reading and writing
them are also standard? I think you know <a href="operator.html#fqa-13.6">the answer</a>. But no matter: you can create a template operator
printing all kinds of <tt>map</tt>. So can I. We&#39;re both happy, unless we have to integrate our code into a single program some
time later. We both used the same intuitive name - <tt>operator&lt;&lt;</tt> - for our printing functions. Normally we&#39;d rename one of the two,
but in this special case, this is <i>really</i> going to be ugly - for instance, other templates will break because they
think everything can be printed with <tt>&lt;&lt;</tt>, and even if there aren&#39;t any, <tt>printMap(std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;map: &quot;, myMap) &lt;&lt; std::endl</tt>
is too ugly even for seasoned C++ developers, who do have pretty low standards.
</p>

<p>
The real fun starts when two people overload (or specialize or whatever they call it) the operators for <i>special
cases of types</i> in conflicting ways. For instance, I know how to print <tt>std::map&lt;std::string,T&gt;</tt>, and you know how to print <tt>std::map&lt;T,int&gt;</tt>.
The question is, who gets to print <tt>std::map&lt;std::string,int&gt;</tt>? The compiler is in trouble, and when a C++ compiler
is in trouble, it immediately empties its bowl, dumping a nice, large, stinky error message right at our faces.
Happy, happy, joy, joy, dear colleague.

 Open the stream with the <tt>std::ios::binary</tt> flag. That way, the stream will not translate between <tt>&#39;\n&#39;</tt> and
the target platform representation of line termination, which may be different (for instance, Windows uses CRLF).
</p>

<p>
<b class="FQA">FQA:</b> With <tt>fopen</tt>, pass the <tt>&quot;b&quot;</tt> character in the options string. This whole issue is pretty annoying, especially
if you work with binary files on a system where <tt>&#39;\n&#39;</tt> is not actually translated, and forget to open them as binary,
and everything works, and then you port the program to
a system where <tt>&#39;\n&#39;</tt> actually is translated, and then you have to find all those cases and open the files as binary. However, this is
not the fault of C++. It is the fault of the distributed nature of the human race, which fails to standardize the
simplest things.
</p>

<p>
Many programs may screw up your binary files due to this family of issues, for instance, many FTP clients will do so unless
explicitly told otherwise.

<b class="FAQ"><a href="http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/input-output.html#faq-15.13">FAQ:</a></b>
 There&#39;s no portable way to do it.
</p>

<p>
<b class="FQA">FQA:</b> That&#39;s probably the fault of all those different incompatible systems rather than C++ or any other programming language.

<h2>[15.14] How can I write/read objects of my class to/from a data file?</h2>

 Read the section about serialization.
</p>

<p>
<b class="FQA">FQA:</b> The FQA doesn&#39;t have a section about a serialization. Short summary: you&#39;re in for a rude awakening. There&#39;s no
standard serialization mechanism in C++. Furthermore, there&#39;s no way to define a reasonable custom one since
there&#39;s no reflection (no way to figure out the structure of an arbitrary object given a pointer to it,
no way to create an object of a class given its name or some other sort of ID, etc.).
</p>

<p>
However, there are many custom
packages for serialization (typically thousands of source code lines, requiring you to use hairy macros/templates for each serialized class member).
Or you can roll your own, or you can dump the whole snapshot of your process to a file in non-portable ways
(may be the cheapest thing to do more frequently than it sounds).

<h2>[15.16] Why can&#39;t I open a file in a different directory such as <tt>&quot;..\test.dat&quot;</tt>?</h2>

<p>
<b class="FAQ"><a href="http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/input-output.html#faq-15.16">FAQ:</a></b>
 Because <tt>\t</tt> expands to the tab character. Use <tt>\\t</tt> to say &quot;backslash followed by t&quot;.
</p>

<p>
<b class="FQA">FQA:</b> You have to escape certain things somehow, so this is perfectly legitimate - unlike the fact that the C++ standard library has no way to <i>open a directory</i>, for example.

<h2>[15.17] How can I tell {if a key, which key} was pressed before the user presses the ENTER key?</h2>

<p>
<b class="FAQ"><a href="http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/input-output.html#faq-15.17">FAQ:</a></b>
 The C++ standard doesn&#39;t even assume your system has a keyboard. So there&#39;s no portable way.
</p>

<p>
<b class="FQA">FQA:</b> Good for the C++ standard, but is there a reason not to provide a standard interface for systems which do have a keyboard?

<h2>[15.18] How can I make it so keys pressed by users are not echoed on the screen?</h2>

<p>
<b class="FAQ"><a href="http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/input-output.html#faq-15.18">FAQ:</a></b>
 You can&#39;t. See <a href="io.html#fqa-15.17">above</a>.
</p>

<p>
<b class="FQA">FQA:</b> Yep, some systems don&#39;t have screens - we sure shouldn&#39;t support the ones that do.
</p>

<p>
Interestingly, the C++ standard assumes that your system has persistent files, and has separate output and error streams. Even more interestingly,
it assumes that you might need Unicode output and locales. You&#39;d be surprised to find out some of the strange places
where devices carrying dead code supporting these features live.

<p>
<b class="FAQ"><a href="http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/input-output.html#faq-15.19">FAQ:</a></b>
 Using whichever way that works on your system. It&#39;s not related to the C++ standard.
</p>

<p>
<b class="FQA">FQA:</b> You should have spotted a <a href="io.html#fqa-15.17">trend</a> by now.

<h2>[15.20] How can I clear the screen? Is there something like <tt>clrscr()</tt>?</h2>

<p>
<b class="FAQ"><a href="http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/input-output.html#faq-15.20">FAQ:</a></b>
 There is, but not in the C++ standard. It&#39;s system-specific.
</p>

<p>
<b class="FQA">FQA:</b> So are windows, sockets and regular expressions. You see, the C++ standard <a href="io.html#fqa-15.18">doesn't assume you have a screen</a>, a network
controller or hardware for regular expression matching.
</p>

<p>
The lame standard library is another one of those things making using C++ a joy.

<h2>[15.21] How can I change the colors on the screen?</h2>

<p>
<b class="FAQ"><a href="http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/input-output.html#faq-15.21">FAQ:</a></b>
 Depends on your system. The C++ standard doesn&#39;t refer to this.
</p>

<p>
<b class="FQA">FQA:</b> But there&#39;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code">an ANSI standard</a> that does. There are some ugly character sequences you can send to
<tt>cout</tt>/<tt>stdout</tt>; you don&#39;t need to call any special functions. Many terminals support this.
