<h2>[14.1] What is a <tt>friend</tt>?</h2>

<p>
<b class="FAQ"><a href="http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/friends.html#faq-14.1">FAQ:</a></b>
 A class can declare other classes and/or functions as friends. The declaration allows the friends to
access non-<tt>public</tt> class members unaccessible to other code outside of the class.
</p>

<p>
<b class="FQA">FQA:</b> In other words, <tt>friend</tt> refines the access control provided by the <tt>private</tt> keyword.
Which means it&#39;s almost useless, simply because <tt>private</tt> is <a href="class.html#fqa-7.4">almost useless</a>. Specifically,
it fails to provide <i>encapsulation</i>, and therefore is little more than a <i>comment</i>.
</p>

<p>
If you define interfaces between modules developed independently and want these interfaces to be stable,
it&#39;s better to <a href="picture.html#fqa-6.3">use C for the interface definitions</a>, not C++. If you insist on using C++ (forcing both modules to be built with the same tools),
relying on <tt>private</tt> to provide encapsulation is a bad idea, because changing private members triggers recompilation
of the client code. You can use <a href="class.html#fqa-7.5">forward declarations</a> and/or <a href="inheritance-virtual.html#fqa-20.1">pure abstract classes</a> to
provide a more stable interface.
</p>

<p>
If you work on the internal interfaces between the different classes of a module, and you&#39;re stuck with C++,
using <tt>private</tt> is surely better than defining all members <tt>public</tt>. This way, someone can easily tell
that a member is not accessed outside of the class, and clarity is good. However, there is little reason
to obsess with the fine details of access control in the internal interfaces.
</p>

<p>
Most of the time, the distinction
between <tt>private</tt> and <tt>public</tt> is good enough to describe what you want. If you feel a strong urge to split
tightly coupled functions between several classes, you can do it with <tt>friend</tt>, or you can make the members
<tt>public</tt>. Of course it&#39;s possible to argue forever about this (&quot;But it&#39;s bad design to allow <i>everyone</i> to access the members!&quot;,
&quot;But it&#39;s bad design to have tightly coupled classes!&quot;). However, these are some of the internal classes of a module,
nothing more, nothing less.
If the module has reasonable size, the access control is not that big a deal. If the module is huge, you have a huge
problem either way, especially with C++, which compiles forever and doesn&#39;t localize the damage of run time errors.
</p>

<p>
Therefore, <tt>friend</tt> is totally useless for the external interfaces and almost useless for the internal interfaces.
So there you are.

<h2>[14.2] Do friends violate encapsulation?</h2>

<p>
<b class="FAQ"><a href="http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/friends.html#faq-14.2">FAQ:</a></b>
 On the contrary - they enhance it. If used properly, of course.
</p>

<p>
For example, you can use them to split code into two classes and have their data inaccessible for code in all other classes.
Or you can use them as &quot;a syntactic variant&quot; of member functions.
</p>

<p>
Think of the friends as part of the class interface instead of something outside the class.
</p>

<p>
<b class="FQA">FQA:</b> What encapsulation? C++ doesn&#39;t have encapsulation. It has access control
(code outside of a class using <tt>private</tt> members of this class will not compile), but it has neither compile time encapsulation
(stable binary interfaces) nor run time encapsulation (safe memory access). What&#39;s there to violate?
</p>

<p>
The case of two classes was discussed in <a href="friend.html#fqa-14.1">the previous FAQ</a>; this argument only sounds convincing if you think C++ classes
are a good way to define the important, stable interfaces in your system.
</p>

<p>
As to the &quot;syntactic variant&quot; business, it&#39;s probably about <a href="operator.html#fqa-13.1">overloaded operators</a>. The C++ syntax makes it impossible
to define overloaded operators as class members unless the first argument is an object of the class. Since C++
uses <tt>stream&lt;&lt;obj</tt> to print things, many classes declare
a <tt>friend operator&lt;&lt;</tt>, for example. This argument is only interesting if you think C++ operator overloading is any good.
</p>


<a name="fqa-14.3"></a>
<h2>[14.3] What are some advantages/disadvantages of using <tt>friend</tt> functions?</h2>

<p>
<b class="FAQ"><a href="http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/friends.html#faq-14.3">FAQ:</a></b>
 Advantage: they allow the designer to choose between <tt>obj.func()</tt> and <tt>func(obj)</tt>, which &quot;lowers maintenance costs&quot;.
</p>

<p>
Disadvantage: they require more code to achieve dynamic binding. Non-member functions can&#39;t be <tt>virtual</tt>, so if the
designer&#39;s syntax of choice is <tt>func(obj)</tt>, and dynamic binding is needed, <tt>func</tt> will have to delegate to a <tt>protected virtual</tt>
member with <tt>obj.func()</tt>.
</p>

<p>
<b class="FQA">FQA:</b> Listen carefully, this is an excellent opportunity to learn about the C++ approach to writing software.
Choosing between two equivalent syntactic forms is called &quot;design&quot;. The availability of many forms and the
&quot;right&quot; choice between them is expected to &quot;lower maintenance costs&quot;. Does this make any sense at all?
Have you seen headlines such as &quot;An engineer replaced <tt>obj.func()</tt> with <tt>func(obj)</tt>, profits sky-rocket&quot;
or &quot;A researcher wins the Turing award for discovering a new way to replace <tt>obj.func()</tt> with <tt>func(obj)</tt>&quot;?
</p>

<p>
And why not say out loud that the real choice is between <tt>obj&lt;&lt;stream</tt> and <tt>stream&lt;&lt;obj</tt> or something like this?
This is really about operator overloading, because that&#39;s where the member/global function distinction matters most
syntactically. Why not just say <tt>obj.print(stream)</tt> instead of shifting streams by the amount of bits in an object
or something?
</p>


<a name="fqa-14.4"></a>
<h2>[14.4] What does it mean that &quot;friendship isn&#39;t inherited, transitive, or reciprocal&quot;?</h2>

<p>
<b class="FAQ"><a href="http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/friends.html#faq-14.4">FAQ:</a></b>
 It means that classes derived from a friend class don&#39;t automatically become friends (do <i>you</i> trust the kids of your friends?),
a friend of a friend doesn&#39;t automatically become a friend (do <i>you</i> trust the friends of your friends?), and that a class
declaring another class as &quot;friend&quot; doesn&#39;t automatically become a friend of that class (do <i>you</i> trust anyone who calls you a friend?).
</p>

<p>
<b class="FQA">FQA:</b> The real life analogies are too scary for a detailed discussion. &quot;Do <i>your</i> friends have access to your members&quot;?
</p>

<p>
One reason to avoid friends is that the only possible benefit is a little extra clarity, but this benefit can be
dwarfed by the extra obfuscation - not everyone is (or should be) 100% sure what <tt>friend</tt> means when it comes
to class hierarchies and stuff.
</p>


<a name="fqa-14.5"></a>
<h2>[14.5] Should my class declare a member function or a <tt>friend</tt> function?</h2>

<p>
<b class="FAQ"><a href="http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/friends.html#faq-14.5">FAQ:</a></b>
 Use a member function unless you must use a <tt>friend</tt> function. For example, you may need <tt>friend</tt> for operator overloading.
</p>

<p>
<b class="FQA">FQA:</b> The FAQ says it at last! See? It was about operator overloading <a href="friend.html#fqa-14.3">all the way</a>.
</p>

<p>
The FAQ&#39;s advice may be further simplified if we use the observation that C++ operator overloading is just a pain in the neck.
